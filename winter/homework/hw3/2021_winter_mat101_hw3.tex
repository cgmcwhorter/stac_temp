% Problem 3
\problem{10} Suppose you invest \$5,600 in an account that earns 6\% annual interest compounded quarterly. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Write a function which gives the amount of money in the account after $t$ years.
\item Find the amount of money in the account after 7 years. 
\item Find the amount of money in the account after 27~months. 
\end{enumerate}



\newpage



% Problem 4
\problem{10} Suppose you invested money in an account which compounds interest discretely. The amount of money in the account after $t$ years is given by $M(t)= 683(1.0175)^{2t}$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item How much was initially invested in the account?
\item How often is the interest compounded?
\item What is the interest rate on the account?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What is the cost per egg?
\item Approximately how much should 75 eggs cost?
\item How many eggs could one purchase for \$27.30?

% Problem 6
\problem{10} Assume you have been driving on a highway for 3~hours and have traveled 191~miles.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What is your average rate of speed?
\item Assuming you continue at this rate of speed, how far will you have traveled 4.5~hours from now?
\item Continuing at this speed, how long would it take to travel an additional 500~miles?
\end{enumerate}

% Problem 7
\problem{10} The bones on a certain species of bird are approximately proportional to its wingspan. For one of its subspecies, a bird with a wing bone length of 1.5~ft has a wing span of 8.3~ft. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item If you find the remains of another bird of this subspecies with a bone length of 2.2~ft, how much would you estimate its wingspan was?
\item If a bird of this subspecies has a wingspan of 7.9~ft, how long would you estimate the bone in its wing to be?
\item Suppose you find a different species of bird with a wingspan of 3.8~ft and bone length of 0.79~ft. Do these two species of birds have approximately the same proportion of wingspan to bone length?
\end{enumerate}
