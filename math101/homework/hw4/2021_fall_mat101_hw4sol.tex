% Problem 4
\problem{10} Suppose you work a job where you are paid \$7.85/hr. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item How much do you make after working 40~hours?
\item How much do you make after working 36.5~hours?
\item How many \textit{whole} hours would you have to work to make \$800?
\end{enumerate} \pspace

\sol 
{\itshape
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 
	\[
	40~\text{hr} \cdot \$7.85\text{/hr}= \$314
	\] \pspace

\item 
	\[
	36.5~\text{hr} \cdot \$7.85\text{/hr}= \$286.525 \approx \$286.53
	\] \pspace

\item 
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	x~\text{hr} \cdot \$7.85\text{/hr}&= \$800 \\[0.3cm]
	x&= \dfrac{\$800}{\$7.85\text{/hr}} \\[0.3cm]
	x&= 101.91~\text{hr}
	\end{aligned}
	\] 
Therefore, one would have to work 102~hours. 
\end{enumerate}

% Problem 5
\problem{10} Suppose you work a job where you make \$9.50/hr for the first 40 regular hours you work. After that, you make time and a half, i.e. you make 50\% more per hour. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item How much do you make if you work 35~hours in a week?
\item How much do you make if you work 45~hours in a week?
\item Suppose you start work at 8:41~am and leave at 4:32~pm. How much have you make that day?
\end{enumerate} \pspace

\sol
{\itshape
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 
	\[
	35~\text{hr} \cdot \$9.50\text{/hr}= \$332.50
	\] \pspace

\item For the first 40~hrs, you make \$9.50/hr. For the last 5~hrs, you make time and a half, i.e. $\$9.50\text{/hr}(1 + 0.50)= \$9.50\text{/hr}(1.50)= \$14.25\text{/hr}$. Then one makes\dots
	\[
	40~\text{hr} \cdot \$9.50\text{/hr} + 5~\text{hr} \cdot \$14.50\text{/hr}= \$380 + \$72.50= \$452.50
	\] \pspace

\item The time from 8:41~am until 4:32~pm is 7~hours and 51~minutes. That is $7 + \frac{51}{60}= 7.85~\text{hours}$. But then one makes\dots
	\[
	7.85 \cdot \$9.50\text{/hr}= \$74.575 \approx \$74.58
	\]
\end{enumerate}

% Problem 6
\problem{10} Suppose you work at a car dealership where you are paid on commission, i.e. you are paid based on how much you sell. The dealership pays you either a weekly salary of \$800/week or 6.5\% of whatever you sell that week---whichever is greater.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item How much are you paid if you have \$8,411.37 in sales that week?
\item How much are you paid if you have \$12,567.96 in sales that week?
\item At least how much would you have to sell (to the nearest dollar) in order to make your base-rate weekly salary?
\item Suppose you sold deck sets that cost \$250. Based on your answer from (c), how many deck sets would you have to sell each week in order to make more than your base weekly salary? 
\end{enumerate} \pspace

\sol
{\itshape
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item We know that 6.5\% of your sales for the week is $\$8411.37(0.065)= \$546.74$. Because this is less than one's baselines salary of \$800, the salary for the week is \$800. \pspace

\item We know that 6.5\% of your sales for the week is $\$12567.96(0.065)= \$816.92$. Because this is less than one's baselines salary of \$800, the salary for the week is \$816.92. \pspace

\item We want to know the amount of sales, say $x$, so that $x(0.065)= \$800$. But then $x= \frac{\$800}{0.065}= \$12307.69$. Therefore, one would have to make at least \$12,307.69 in sales that week to make as much as one's base rate salary. \pspace

\item To make the base rate salary, one needs \$12307.69 in sales. Because each deck set costs \$250, one would need to sell at least $\frac{12307.69}{250}= 49.23$ deck sets. This means one need sell either 49 or 50 deck sets. Selling less deck sets would result in less sales. Therefore, one need sell 50 deck sets.
