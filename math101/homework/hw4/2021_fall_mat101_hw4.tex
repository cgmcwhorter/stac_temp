% Problem
\problem{10} Suppose you work a job where you are paid \$7.85/hr. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item How much do you make after working 40~hours?
\item How much do you make after working 36.5~hours?
\item How many \textit{whole} hours would you have to work to make \$800?
\end{enumerate}

% Problem
\problem{10} Suppose you work a job where you make \$9.50/hr for the first 40 regular hours you work. After that, you make time and a half, i.e. you make 50\% more per hour. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item How much do you make if you work 35~hours in a week?
\item How much do you make if you work 45~hours in a week?
\item Suppose you start work at 8:41~am and leave at 4:32~pm. How much have you make that day?
\end{enumerate}

% Problem
\problem{10} Suppose you work at a car dealership where you are paid on commission, i.e. you are paid based on how much you sell. The dealership pays you either a weekly salary of \$800/week or 6.5\% of whatever you sell that week---whichever is greater.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item How much are you paid if you have \$8,411.37 in sales that week?
\item How much are you paid if you have \$12,567.96 in sales that week?
\item At least how much would you have to sell (to the nearest dollar) in order to make your base-rate weekly salary?
\item Suppose you sold deck sets that cost \$250. Based on your answer from (c), how many deck sets would you have to sell each week in order to make more than your base weekly salary? 
\end{enumerate}
