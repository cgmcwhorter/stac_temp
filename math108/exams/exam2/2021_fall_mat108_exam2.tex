% Question 5
\newpage
\question[10] Suppose a researcher wants to create a linear model to predict a certain crop's average growth, $g$, in cm using the average number of hours of sunlight, $h$, the crops receive per day. They sample 61 different fields and collect the following data:
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	\overline{h}&= 10 & \overline{g}&= 120 \\
	s_h^2&= 4 & s_g^2&= 64 \\
	n&= 61 & r&= 0.5
	\end{aligned}

\part Find the linear regression model to predict the growth rate using the number of hours of sunlight. \vspace{5cm}
\part Predict the average growth of crops that receive an average of 8~hours of sunlight. \vfill
\part Suppose that a crop which receives an average of 9~hours of sunlight per day grows an average of 110~cm. Find the residual for the model's prediction. Is the prediction an under or over prediction? \vfill
\part Does the average growth rate of the crops appear to be strongly correlated with the average number of hours of sunlight they receive per day? Explain. \vfill

% Question 7

% Question 8
\newpage
\question[10] Hugh Nowes and his wife Ivana purchase a \$100,000 home, making a \$20,000 down payment. They get a mortgage for the remaining balance at an annual interest rate of 8.5\% compounded monthly that will be repaid in monthly installments over a 20~year payment. \pspace
        \begin{parts}
        \part What are the monthly payments? \vfill
        \part How much is owed after 10~years? \vfill

        \begin{parts}
        \item How much money will the account have after 30~years? \vfill
        \item How much should he deposit each year if he would like \$50,000 in 30~years for his retirement? \vfill
