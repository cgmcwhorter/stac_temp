\homework{9: Due 03/08}{One of the first things taught in introductory statistics textbooks is that correlation is not causation. It is also one of the first things forgotten.}{Thomas Sowell}

% Problem 1
\problem{10} Anwesh is comparing costs of homes in different areas. In a particular suburb, the house prices are approximately normally distributed with mean \$430,000 and standard deviation \$50,000. While in a particular rural area, the house prices are normally distributed with mean \$250,000 and standard deviation \$17,000. In which area would a house that costs \$290,000 cost more than the average house? Explain. In which area would a house that costs \$290,000 be more `unusual'? Explain.

% Problem 2
\problem{10} Suppose you have the normal distribution $N(224, 46.9)$. Let $X$ be a value randomly drawn from this distribution. Showing all your work, compute the following:
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item $P(X= 220)$
	\item $P(X < 200)$
	\item $P(X < 300)$
	\item $P(X > 300)$
	\item $P(200 < X < 300)$
	\item The value $Y$ that `marks' the largest 8\% of values for this distribution. 
	\end{enumerate}
