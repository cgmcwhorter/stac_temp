\reflection{5: Due 05/03 (04)}{Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death.}{Albert Einstein}

\begin{center} {\Large\bfseries A Semester Self-Reflection} \end{center}

At the beginning of the semester, you were asked to respond to the following prompts:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item What is Mathematics? How do you learn Mathematics?
	\item What does Mathematics `look like'?
	\item Is Mathematics more about memorization or thinking skills?
	\item What skills do you need to succeed at Mathematics?
	\item What does `good' mathematics `look like'?
	\end{itemize}
Examine your answers from the beginning of the semester. Respond to each of the above prompts again. Compare your answers to the ones you gave at the beginning of the semester. What, if anything, has changed about your responses? Why did your response change or stay the same?
