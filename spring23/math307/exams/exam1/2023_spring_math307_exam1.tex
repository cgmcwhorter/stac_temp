% Question 40
\question Jose has been gathering data on the amount of snowfall in his local community. He reads off the snow levels using a ruler attached to a wall outside his classroom. He finds the mean and standard deviation for the data he gathered. However, after performing this computation, he realizes that the ruler was 0.2" above the ground. If Jose corrects this error in his data, what will happen to the mean and standard deviation for his data?
	\begin{enumerate}[A.]
	\item The mean and standard deviation will decrease.
	\item The mean will decrease, but the standard deviation will stay the same.
	\item The mean will decrease, but the standard deviation will increase.
	\item The mean will stay the same, but the standard deviation will decrease.
