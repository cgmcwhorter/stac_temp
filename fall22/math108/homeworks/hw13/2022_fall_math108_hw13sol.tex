% Problem 2
\problem{10} You and your friends are all `serial late arrivals', i.e. you always tend to be late for things. There is an 80\% chance that you and your friends are late for events. Suppose you and 6 of your friends are invited to a party.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item What is the probability that exactly four of you are late?
	\item What is the probability that all of you are late?
	\item What is the probability that more than three of you are on time?
	\item What is the probability that none of you are late?
	\end{enumerate}
