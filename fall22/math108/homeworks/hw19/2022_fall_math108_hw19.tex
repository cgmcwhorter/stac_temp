\homework{19: Due 12/08}{Linear programming can be viewed as part of a great revolutionary development which has given mankind the ability to state general goals and to lay out a path of detailed decisions to take in order to `best' achieve its goals when faced with practical situations of great complexity.}{George Dantzig}

% Problem 1
\problem{10} Write down the initial simplex tableau for the following optimization problem:
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	\max z= 4.6x_1 + \,&3.1x_2 + 7.9x_3 \\
	5.5x_1 - 6x_2 + \,&1.1x_3 \leq 110.3 \\
	-6.7x_1 - \,&8.3 x_3 \leq 220.1 \\
	x_1 - 7.7x_2 + \,&4.5x_3 \leq 662.0 \\
	x_1, \, &x_2, x_3 \geq 0 
	\end{aligned}
	\]

% Problem 2
\problem{10} Suppose that the initial simplex tableau below was associated to a standard maximization problem. Write down the function being maximized and the corresponding system of constraints. \par
	\begin{table}[!ht]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{rrrrrr|r}
	$2$ & $-1$ & $4$ & $1$ & $0$ & $0$ & $100$ \\
	$6$ & $0$ & $2$ & $0$ & $1$ & $0$ & $80$ \\
	$-4$ & $8$ & $3$ & $0$ & $0$ & $1$ & $220$ \\ \hline
	$-3$ & $-1$ & $-5$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

% Problem 3
\problem{10} Suppose that the final simplex tableau associated to a maximization problem was the following: \par
	\begin{table}[!ht]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrrrr}
	$1$ & $1.1$ & $2$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0.22$ & $0.067$ & $-0.011$ & $0$ & $140$ \\
	$0$ & $2.1$ & $1.5$ & $1$ & $0$ & $-0.021$ & $0.23$ & $-0.037$ & $0$ & $85$ \\
	$0$ & $-1.1$ & $-0.59$ & $0$ & $1$ & $0.008$ & $-0.088$ & $0.16$ & $0$ & $42$ \\

	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item How many inequalities were considered?
\item How many variables were there in the original inequalities?
\item How many slack/surplus variables were introduced?
\item What was the solution to this maximization problem?
\end{enumerate}
