% Problem 1
\problem{10} Below are two charts giving information on survival/death for the April 15, 1912 sinking of the Titanic. 
        \begin{table}[h]
        \centering
        \scalebox{0.93}{%
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c||c|} \hline
         & Men & Women & Boys & Girls & Total \\ \hline 
         Survived & 338 & 316 & 29 & 27 & 710 \\ \hline
         Died & 1352 & 109 & 35 & 18 & 1514 \\ \hline \hline

% Problem 2
\problem{10} Some construction companies work exclusively with large businesses constructing office spaces, warehouses, etc. Others work in residential construction, and some work in both. Suppose that 47\% of construction companies work in business construction, 35\% of companies work in residential construction, and 12\% work in either area. 
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Find the percentage of companies that work in business or residential construction.
        \item Find the percentage of companies that work in neither business nor residential construction.
        \item Find the percentage of companies that work exclusively in business construction.
        \item Find the percentage of companies that work in residential construction that also do business construction.
        \item Find the percentage of companies that work exclusively in business or residential construction. 
        \end{enumerate}

% Problem 3
\problem{10} Suppose a disease only occurs in approximately 2\% of the population. A test is developed that detects this disease in those that have it 97\% of the time, and only incorrectly identifies those that do not have the disease as having it 4\% of the time. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Find the probability that a person tests positive for the disease. 
	\item Assuming independence, what is the probability that you test positive twice if you do not have the disease?
	\item Find the probability that a person has the disease or tests positive. 
	\item Find the probability that a person that tests positive for the disease actually has the disease. 
	\item Does your response in (d) contradict the fact that the test is `97\% accurate'? Explain. 
	\end{enumerate}
