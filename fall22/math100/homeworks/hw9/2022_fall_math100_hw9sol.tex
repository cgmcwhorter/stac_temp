\homework{9: Due 10/26}{There's nothing inside you. I invented you inside my head. For 12~years, I've been inventing you---I made you up.}{Sunny Balwani, The Droupout}

% Problem 1
\problem{10} Louise just read \textit{Remembrance of Things Past} by Marcel Proust, which is approximately 3,200~pages long. She kept careful track of the time she was at various pages. She found that she count model the amount of pages she had read, $P$, after $t$ hours by $P(t)= 65t$.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Find and interpret the slope of $P(t)$.
	\item Find and interpret the $y$-intercept of $P(t)$.
	\item How long did it take her to read this work?
	\end{enumerate}



\newpage



% Problem 2
\problem{10} Suppose that the number of people, $N$ that have ridden the subway $t$~hours after 8:00~am can be modeled by $N(t)= 8429t - 1008$. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Find and interpret the slope of $N(t)$.
	\item Does the $y$-intercept of $N(t)$ have an interpretation in the context of this problem? Explain.
	\item Find the number of people that have ridden the subway by 5~pm. 
	\end{enumerate}
