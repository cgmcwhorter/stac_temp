\homework{8: Due 10/17}{Every single line means something.}{Jean-Michel Basquiat}

% Problem 1
\problem{10} Find the equation of the line with slope $-\frac{2}{3}$ that passes through the point $(-9 ,10)$. 



\newpage



% Problem 2
\problem{10} Find the equation of the line passing through the points $(-5, 8)$ and $(7, 8)$. 



\newpage



% Problem 3
\problem{10} Let $\ell(x)= 18.2 - 13.7x$. Find the slope and $y$-intercept of this function. 



\newpage



% Problem 4
\problem{10} Let $\ell(x)= 57.6x - 1654.8$. Explain why $\ell(x)$ is a linear function. Find the $y$-intercept and $x$-intercept of this function.



\newpage



% Problem 5
\problem{10} Suppose you work an hourly job where you are paid \$17.50 an hour. You have already made \$288.75 this week. Let $W$ represent the wages you have been paid by working an addition $h$ hours this week.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Explain why $W$ is a linear function of $h$. 
	\item Explain why $W(h)= 17.50h + 288.75$.
	\item What is the slope and what does it represent?
	\item What is the $y$-intercept and what does it represent?
	\end{enumerate}

% Problem 6
\problem{10} Let $M$ represent the total amount of money in your account $d$ days from now. Suppose that right now you have \$15,000 in your account and that you spend \$530 a day.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Find $M(d)$.
	\item What are the slope and $y$-intercept of $M(d)$? What do they represent?
	\item Find the $x$-intercept of $M(d)$.
	\item Interpret your answer in (c).
