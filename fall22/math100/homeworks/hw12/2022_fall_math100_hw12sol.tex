\homework{12: Due 10/31}{I'm proud to pay taxes in the United States; the only thing is, I could be just as proud for half the money.}{Arthur Godfrey}

% Problem 1
\problem{10} Justin is filing his 2022 taxes. Over the past year, he made \$98,553. He is a single filer taking the standard deduction of \$12,950. The tax brackets for the 2022~tax year are found below. Compute Justin's federal income tax. How much will he make after taxes?  \par
	\begin{table}[!ht]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
	Tax Rate & Taxable Income \\ \hline
	10\% & \$0 -- \$10,275 \\ \hline
	12\% & \$10,276 -- \$41,775 \\ \hline
	22\% & \$41,776 -- \$89,075 \\ \hline
	24\% & \$89,076 -- \$170,050 \\ \hline
	32\% & \$170,051 -- \$215,950 \\ \hline
	35\% & \$215,951 -- \$539,900 \\ \hline
	37\% & \$539,901 or more \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table} \pspace

\sol After tax deductions, Justin has $\$98553 - \$12950= \$85603$ in taxable income. But then we have\dots
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	\text{Tax}&= 0.10(\$10275 - \$0) + 0.12(\$41775 - \$10275) + 0.22(\$85603 - \$41775) \\[0.3cm]
	&= 0.10(\$10275) + 0.12(\$31500) + 0.22(\$43828) \\[0.3cm]
	&= \$1027.50 + \$3780.00 + \$9642.16 \\[0.3cm]
	&= \$14449.70
	\end{aligned}
	\]
Therefore, Justin will pay \$14,449.70 in federal income taxes in 2022.

% Problem 2
\problem{10} If a good that cost \$15 last year now costs \$20, what was the inflation rate from last year to this year? Suppose that this was the true inflation rate. If the CPI last year was \$287.33, what is the CPI this year? \pspace

\sol We have $\frac{\$20}{\$15} \approx 1.3333= 1 + 0.3333$. Therefore, the inflation rate was 33.33\%. But then if the CPI last year was \$287.33, we predict that the CPI this year would be\dots
	\[
	\$287.33(1 + 0.3333)= \$287.33(1.3333) \approx \$383.097
	\]
