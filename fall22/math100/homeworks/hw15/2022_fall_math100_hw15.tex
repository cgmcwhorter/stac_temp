\homework{15: Due 11/07}{Life is a school of probability.}{Walter Bagehot}

% Problem 1
\problem{10} Researchers surveyed 320~people on which superpower from comics they found most interesting/best. A table of their findings are found below.
	\begin{table}[!ht]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c||c|} \hline
	& Child & Adult & Total \\ \hline \hline
	Flight & 30 & 36 & 66 \\ \hline
	Mind Reading & 15 & 60 & 75 \\ \hline
	Super Strength & 40 & 14 & 54 \\ \hline \hline
	Total & 85 & 110 & 195 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Find the probability that a person chose flight as the best superpower.
\item Find the probability that a person surveyed was a child.
\item Find the probability that a person was a child and chose super strength as the most interesting super power.
\item Find the probability that a person chose mind reading or was an adult.
\item Find the probability that a person that chose mind reading was an adult. 
\end{enumerate}

% Problem 2
\problem{10} Consider the breakdown of students majors at a college by gender.
	\begin{table}[!ht]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|} \hline
	& School of Business & School of Education & Arts \& Social Sciences & STEM \\ \hline \hline
	Male & 80 & 85 & 75 & 92 \\ \hline
	Female & 75 & 80 & 90 & 94 \\ \hline
	Unspecified & 8 & 15 & 22 & 1 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Find the probability that a randomly selected person from this school was in education. 
\item Find the probability that a randomly selected person from this school was male.
\item Find the probability that a randomly selected person from this school was a female and in the School of Business.
\item Find the probability that a randomly selected person from this school was in STEM or had unspecified gender.
\item Find the probability that a person was in the school of Arts \& Social Sciences given that their gender was unspecified. 
\end{enumerate}

% Problem 3
\problem{10} Is it always true that for events $A$ and $B$, $P(A \text{ and } B)= P(A) \cdot P(B)$? Explain using an original example.
