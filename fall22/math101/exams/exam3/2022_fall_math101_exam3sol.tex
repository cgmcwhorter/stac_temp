{\itshape The line $y= \frac{3}{2}\,x - 3$ has $y$-intercept $(0, -3)$. The slope of the line is $m= \frac{3}{2}$. Interpreting $m= \frac{3}{2}$ as $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, we see that for each increase of 2 in $x$, there is a corresponding increase of 3 in $y$. Alternatively, writing $m= \frac{3}{2}= \frac{-3}{-2}$ and interpreting this as $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, we see that for each decrease of 2 in $x$, there is a decrease of 3 in $y$. Using the $y$-intercept and these interpretations of the slope to sketch points on the line (shown above), we obtain the sketch of the line.}

\newpage
\question[10] As accurately as possible, plot the line $5x + 4y= 10$ on the graph below. 
	\[

	\] 

{\itshape First, observe that we have\dots
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	5x &+ 4y= 10 \\
	4y&= -5x + 10 \\
	y&= -\frac{5}{4}\,x + \frac{10}{4} \\
	y&= -\frac{5}{4}\,x + \frac{5}{2}
	\end{aligned}
	\]
The line $y= -\frac{5}{4}\,x - 3$ has $y$-intercept $\big(0, \frac{5}{2} \big)$. The slope of the line is $m= -\frac{5}{4}= \frac{-5}{4}$. Interpreting $m= \frac{-5}{4}$ as $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, we see that for each increase of 4 in $x$, there is a corresponding decrease of 5 in $y$. Alternatively, writing $m= -\frac{5}{4}= \frac{5}{-4}$ and interpreting this as $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, we see that for each decrease of 4 in $x$, there is an increase of 5 in $y$. Using the $y$-intercept and these interpretations of the slope to sketch points on the line (shown above), we obtain the sketch of the line. \pspace

Alternatively, considering $5x + 4y= 10$, if $y= 0$, we have $5x= 10$, so that $x= 2$. But then $(2, 0)$ is a point on the line. If $x= 0$, we have $4y= 10$, so that $y= \frac{10}{4}= \frac{5}{2}$. But then $\big(0, \frac{5}{2} \big)$ is on the line. Connecting these points via a straight line, we have the line shown above.

% Question 4
\newpage
\question[10] Consider the line given by $5x - 4y= 7$.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Showing all your work and without referencing a graph, determine if $(-3, -2)$ is on the line. 
	\item Showing all your work and without referencing a graph, determine if $\big(1, -\frac{1}{2} \big)$ is on the line. 
	\end{enumerate} \pspace

\sol 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item We have\dots
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	5x - 4y&= 7 \\
	5(-3) - 4(-2)&\stackrel{?}{=} 7 \\
	-15 + 8&\stackrel{?}{=} 7 \\
	-7&\neq 7 \\
	&\;\text{\xmark}
	\end{aligned}
	\] \pspace

\item We have\dots
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	5x - 4y&= 7 \\
	5(1) - 4 \left(-\frac{1}{2} \right)&\stackrel{?}{=} 7 \\
	5 + 2&\stackrel{?}{=} 7 \\
	7&= 7 \\
	&\;\text{\cmark}
	\end{aligned}
	\]   
\end{enumerate}



% Question 5
\newpage
\question[10] Showing all your work and being sure to list the points, find at least three distinct points on the line $-7x + 3y= 10$. \pspace

\sol {\itshape To find points on the line, we can simple plug-in any value for $x, y$ and solve for the other. For instance, if\dots \pspace

$x= 0$: 
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	-7x + 3y&= 10 \\
	0 + 3y&= 10 \\
	3y&= 10 \\
	y&= \frac{10}{3}
	\end{aligned}
	\]
Therefore, $\big(0, \frac{10}{3} \big)$ is on the line. \pspace

$y= 0$: 
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	-7x + 3y&= 10 \\
	-7x + 0&= 10 \\
	-7x&= 10 \\
	x&= -\frac{10}{7}
	\end{aligned}
	\]
Therefore, $\big( -\frac{10}{7}, 0 \big)$ is on the line. \pspace

$x= 1$: 
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	-7x + 3y&= 10 \\
	-7 + 3y&= 10 \\
	3y&= 17 \\
	y&= \frac{17}{3}
	\end{aligned}
	\]
Therefore, $\big(1, \frac{17}{3} \big)$ is on the line. \pspace

$y= 1$: 
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	-7x + 3y&= 10 \\
	-7x + 3&= 10 \\
	-7x&= 7 \\
	x&= -1
	\end{aligned}
	\]
Therefore, $(-1, 1)$ is on the line. }



% Question 6
\newpage
\question[10] Consider the linear function $f(x)= 7 - \frac{6}{5}\,x$. Showing all your work, answer the following:
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Find the rate of change of $f(x)$.
	\item Interpret the rate of change of $f(x)$. 
	\item Determine whether $f(x)$ is an increasing or decreasing function.
	\item Determine the $y$-intercept of $f(x)$.
	\item Find the exact value of $f \big( \frac{2}{3} \big)$. 
	\end{enumerate} \pspace

\sol {\itshape
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The rate of change of $f(x)$ is the slope. Because $f(x)$ has the form $y= mx + b$, we see that the slope of $f(x)$ is $m= -\frac{6}{5}$. \pspace

\item We have $m= -\frac{6}{5}$. Writing $m= -\frac{6}{5}= \frac{-6}{5}$ and interpreting this as $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, we see that each increase of 5 in $x$ results in a decrease of 6 in $y$. Alternatively, writing $m= -\frac{6}{5}= \frac{6}{-5}$ and interpreting this as $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, we see that each decrease of 5 in $x$ results in an increase of 6 in $y$. \pspace

\item Because $m= -\frac{6}{5} < 0$, we see that $f(x)$ is decreasing. \pspace

\item Because $f(x)= 7 - \frac{6}{5}\,x$ has the form $y= mx + b$, we see that the $y$-intercept is $7$, i.e. $(0, 7)$. \pspace

\item We have\dots
	\[
	f \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)= 7 - \frac{6}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{3}= 7 - \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{1}= 7 - \frac{4}{5}= \frac{35}{5} - \frac{4}{5}= \frac{31}{5}
	\]
\end{enumerate}
}



% Question 7
\newpage
\question[10] Consider the linear function $f(x)= -3(2x - 7)$. Showing all your work, answer the following:
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Find the rate of change of $f(x)$.
	\item Interpret the rate of change of $f(x)$. 
	\item Determine whether $f(x)$ is an increasing or decreasing function.
	\item Determine the $x$-intercept of $f(x)$.
	\item Find an $x$-value such that $f(x)= 9$.
	\end{enumerate} \pspace

\sol {\itshape First, we write $f(x)= -3(2x - 7)= -6x + 21$. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The rate of change of $f(x)$ is the slope. Because $f(x)= -6x + 21$ has the form $y= mx + b$, we see that the slope of $f(x)$ is $m= -6$. \pspace

\item We have $m= -6$. Writing $m= -6= \frac{-6}{1}$ and interpreting this as $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, we see that each increase of 1 in $x$ results in a decrease of 6 in $y$. Alternatively, writing $m= -6= -\frac{6}{1}= \frac{6}{-1}$ and interpreting this as $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, we see that each decrease of 1 in $x$ results in an increase of 6 in $y$. \pspace

\item Because $m= -6 < 0$, we see that $f(x)$ is decreasing. \pspace

\item The $x$-intercept occurs when $f(x)= 0$. But then\dots
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	f(x)&= 0 \\
	-3(2x - 7)&= 0 \\
	2x - 7&= 0 \\
	2x&= 7 \\
	x&= \frac{7}{2}
	\end{aligned}
	\]
Therefore, the $x$-intercept is $\frac{7}{2}$, i.e. $\big( \frac{7}{2}, 0 \big)$. \pspace

\item If $f(x)= 9$, we have\dots
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	f(x)&= 9 \\
	-6x + 21&= 9 \\
	-6x&= -12 \\
	x&= 2
	\end{aligned}
	\]
We can check: $f(2)= -6(2) + 21= -12 + 21= 9$.
\end{enumerate}
}



% Question 8
\newpage
\question[10] Find the equation of the line parallel to the line $y= 6 - x$ that has $x$-intercept $-12$. \pspace

\sol {\itshape Because the line is parallel to $y= 6 - x$, the line has the form $y= mx + b$. Because the line is parallel to $y= 6 - x$, it must have the same slope. The slope of the line $y= 6 - x$ has slope $-1$; therefore, the line has slope $m= -1$. Because the line has $x$-intercept $-12$, we know that $(-12, 0)$ is on the line. But then we have\dots
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	y&= mx + b \\[0.3cm]
	y&= -x + b \\[0.3cm]
	0&= -(-12) + b \\[0.3cm]
	0&= 12 + b \\[0.3cm]
	b&= -12
	\end{aligned}
	\]
Therefore, the line is $y= -x - 12$. 
}



% Question 9
\newpage
\question[10] Find the equation of the line perpendicular to the line $y= -\frac{\pi}{2}$ that contains the $x$-intercept of the line $-7x + 5y= -3$. \pspace

\sol {\itshape Because the line is perpendicular to $y= -\frac{\pi}{2}$, which is horizontal, our line must be vertical. Therefore, the line has the form $x= c$ for some $c$. The $x$-intercept of the line $-7x + 5y= -3$ occurs when $y= 0$. But then we have $-7x= -3$. But then $x= \frac{3}{7}$. Therefore, the line contains the point $\big(\frac{3}{7}, 0 \big)$. But then the line must be $x= \frac{3}{7}$.}



% Question 10
\newpage
\question[10] Find the equation of the line that contains the $y$-intercept of $y= \frac{7}{11}\,x - 5$ and the point of intersection of $y= 4 - 3x$ and $y= \frac{1}{2}\,x + 18$. \pspace

\sol {\itshape Because the line $y= \frac{7}{11}\,x - 5$ has the form $y= mx + b$, the its $y$-intercept is $(0, -5)$. We now find the point of intersection of $y= 4 - 3x$ and $y= \frac{1}{2}\,x + 18$:
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	4 - 3x&= \frac{1}{2}\,x + 18 \\
	2(4 - 3x)&= 2 \left( \frac{1}{2}\,x + 18 \right) \\
	8 - 6x&= x + 36 \\
	8 - 7x&= 36 \\
	-7x&= 28 \\
	x&= -4
	\end{aligned}
	\]
Using this in the line $y= 4 - 3x$. We have $y= 4 - 3(-4)= 4 + 12= 16$. Therefore, the line contains the point $(-4, 16)$. Because the line contains the point $(0, -5)$ and $(-4, 16)$, we have\dots
	\[
	m= \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}= \dfrac{16 - (-5)}{-4 - 0}= \dfrac{16 + 5}{-4 - 0}= \dfrac{21}{-4}= -\frac{21}{4}
	\]
But the line contains $(0, -5)$, so that we have\dots
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	y&= mx + b \\
	-5&= -\frac{21}{4} \cdot 0 + b \\
	-5&= 0 + b \\
	b&= -5
	\end{aligned}
	\]
Therefore, the line $y= -\frac{21}{4}\,x - 5$.

\question[10] Without explicitly finding the intersection, explain why the following lines $y= 2(7 - 5x)$ and $y= 5x + 2$ intersect. Showing all your work, find the intersection of the lines. \pspace

\sol {\itshape The line $y= 2(7 - 5x)= 14 - 10x$ has some $m= -10$. The line $y= 5x + 2$ has slope 5. Because $-10 \neq 5$, the lines cannot be parallel. But because the lines are not parallel, the lines must intersect.}



% Question 14
\newpage
\question[10] Thai Tanic is a new restaurant chain that has been expanding across the Northwest. It is projected that next year, it will have \$800,000 in profits and the following year it will have \$1.2~million in profits. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Under what assumptions is a linear model to predict the growth rate of this business appropriate?
	\item Find a linear model for the profit of this company $t$ years from today. 
	\item Interpret the slope of your linear model in (b).
	\item Interpret the $y$-intercept of your linear model in (b), if possible. 
	\item How long until the company has a profit of \$5~million? 
	\end{enumerate} \pspace

\sol {\itshape We will let the profits, $P$, at a time $t$ years from now be denoted by $P(t)$. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The rate of change of the profits must be constant. \pspace

\item Because $P(t)$ is a linear function, we know $P(t)= mt + b$ for some $m, b$. We know that in a year, the company will have \$800,000 in profits, i.e. $(1, 800000)$ is a point on the graph of $P(t)$. Similarly, because the company makes \$1,200,000 two years from now, $(2, 1200000)$ is on the graph of $P(t)$. But then we have\dots
	\[
	m= \dfrac{1200000 - 800000}{2 - 1}= \dfrac{400000}{1}= 400000
	\]
Because $(1, 800000)$ is on the line, we have\dots
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	P(t)&= mt + b \\
	P(t)&= 400000t + b \\
	800000&= 400000(1) + b \\
	800000&= 400000 + b \\
	b&= 400000
	\end{aligned}
	\]
Therefore, $P(t)= 400000t + 400000= 400000(t + 1)$. \pspace

\item From (b), we know that $m= 400000$. Interpreting $m= 400000= \frac{400000}{1}$ as $\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta t}$, we see that every additional year, the company makes an additional \$400,000 in profit, i.e. the company makes an additional \$400,000 in profit per year. \pspace

\item From (b), the $y$-intercept is 400,000. The $y$-intercept occurs when $t= 0$, i.e. the current year. Therefore, the company is currently making \$400,000 in profit. \pspace

\item If the profit is \$5~million, then $P(t)= 5000000$. But then\dots
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	P(t)&= 5000000 \\
	400000t + 400000&= 5000000 \\
	400000t&= 4600000 \\
	t&= 11.5
	\end{aligned}
	\]
Therefore, the company will have a profit of \$5~million in 11.5~years.

% Question 15
\newpage
\question[10] Sia Gogh is driving down the highway at 65~mph. She has been driving for 2~hours. Sia determines her total distance traveled $t$~hours from now is approximately $D(t)= 65t + 130$. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Explain why her distance traveled is approximately linear.
	\item Interpret the slope of $D(t)$.
	\item Interpret the $y$-intercept of $D(t)$. 
	\item How far has she traveled after a total of 10~hours?
	\end{enumerate} \pspace

\sol {\itshape
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Because $D(t)= 65t + 130$ has the form $y= mx + b$ with $m= 65$, $x= t$, and $b= 130$, we know that $D(t)$ is linear. \pspace

\item The slope of $D(t)= 65t + 130$ is $m= 65$. Interpreting the slope $m= 65= \frac{65}{1}$ as $\frac{\Delta D}{\Delta t}$, we see that every additional hour from now sees her distance driven increasing by 65~miles, i.e. she is currently traveling at an average rate of 65~mph. \pspace

\item The $y$-intercept of $D(t)= 65t + 130$ is 130. The $y$-intercept occurs when $t= 0$, i.e. 0~hours from now. But then currently, her total distance traveled is 130~miles. [Note: She has already driven for 2~hours.] \pspace

\item She has already driven 2~hours. Therefore, she would need to drive an additional 8~hours from now to drive for a total of 10~hours. But then\dots
	\[
	D(8)= 65(8) + 130= 520 + 130= 650 
	\]
Therefore, after a total of 10~hours, she has driven 650~miles.
