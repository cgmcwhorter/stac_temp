\homework{19: Due 11/16}{There is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may not some day be applied to phenomena of the real world.}{Nikolai Lobachevsky}

% Problem 1
\problem{10} An oil company is selling off one of its oil reserves. The amount of oil left in the storage tank in tens of thousands of gallons, $O$, after $d$ days is given by $O(d)= 1600 - 133.4d$.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Find and interpret the slope of $O(d)$ in the context of the problem.
	\item Find and interpret the $y$-intercept of $O(d)$ in the context of the problem.
	\item Find how long it will take the company to sell all the oil in the tank. 
	\item If the company sells the oil for \$2.085/gallon, how much money do they make selling this reserve oil?
	\end{enumerate}



\newpage



% Problem 2
\problem{10} Suppose that last year, the demand for a certain good was 185~thousand units. It is estimated that next year, the demand will be for 221~thousand units. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Assuming that the change in demand is constant, find a linear function predicting the level of demand $t$~years from now.
	\item Interpret the slope and $y$-intercept from your function in (a).
	\item What is your prediction for the level of demand in 5~years?
	\item Predict how many years until the demand is 400~thousand units. 
	\end{enumerate}
