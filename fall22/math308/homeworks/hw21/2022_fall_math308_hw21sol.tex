\sol An undirected graph $G$ has an Euler circuit if and only if $G$ is connected and every vertex has positive even degree. The graph $G$ is connected because given any two vertices there is a walk between them. However, the vertex $v_7$ has odd degree---we have $\deg v_7= 3$. Therefore, $G$ does not have an Euler circuit. \pspace

An undirected graph $G$ has an Euler trail if and only if $G$ is connected and it has exactly two vertices of odd degree. The graph $G$ is connected because given any two vertices there is a walk between them. Observe that $\deg v_1= 3$ (the loop contributes 2 to the degree) and $\deg v_7= 3$. All other vertices of $G$ have even degree. Therefore, $G$ has an Euler trail. For instance, the following is an Euler trail:
	\[
	v_7 \, e_{11} \, v_8 \, e_{10} \, v_6 \, e_6 \, v_7 \, e_9 \, v_4 \, e_4 \, v_3 \, e_3 \, v_2 \, e_7 \, v_5 \, e_5 \, v_6 \, e_8 \, v_3 \, e_2 \, v_1 \, e_1

\item Does $G$ have an Euler trail? If it does, find it. If it does not, explain why. 
\item Does $G$ have a Hamiltonian circuit? If it does, find it. If it does not, explain why. 
\end{enumerate} \pspace

\sol 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item A graph $G$ has an Euler trail if and only if it is connected and every vertex has positive even degree. The graph $G$ is connected because every pair of vertices has a walk from one to the other. Furthermore, every vertex of $G$ has degree 4 except the `leftmost' and `rightmost' vertices which have degree 2. Therefore, $G$ does not have an Euler trail. \pspace

\item A Hamiltonian circuit is a walk which visits every vertex precisely once and starts/ends at the same vertex. The graph $G$ has a Hamiltonian circuit. For instance, there is a Hamiltonian circuit highlighted in red in the graph below:
	\[

The number of walks of length 1 from $b$ to $e$ is $a_{2,5}= 3$. The number of walks of length 1 from $d$ to $b$ is $a_{4,2}= 1$. \pspace

But then the number of walks of length 2 from $c$ to $c$ is $a_{3,3}= 7$. The number of walks of length 2 from $e$ to $a$ is $a_{5,1}= 6$. 

\item The number of walks of length 4 from $v_i$ to $v_j$ is the entry $a_{ij}$ in $A^4= (A^2)^2$. We have\dots

Therefore, the number of walks of length 4 from $a$ to $c$ is $a_{1,3}= 90$. The number of walks of length 4 from $b$ to itself is $a_{2,2}= 295$. \pspace
 
\item The graph $G$ is connected because every two distinct vertices in $G$ has a walk connecting them. Therefore, $G$ has one connected component. \pspace

% Problem 4
\problem{10} Suppose that $G$ is an undirected graph with adjacency matrix, $A$, given below. 
	\[
	A= 
	\begin{pmatrix}
	0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\

	0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
	\end{pmatrix}
	\]
Using only this adjacency matrix, showing all your work, fully justifying your responses, answer the following:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Is $G$ a simple graph?
\item Is $G$ a multigraph?
\item How many connected components does $G$ have?
\item Find the degrees of vertices $v_1$, $v_8$, and $v_5$.
\item What is the degree of $G$?
\end{enumerate} \pspace

\sol 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item A graph $G$ is simple if and only if it does not have loops or multiple edges. A loop is an edge from a vertex to itself. But this occurs if and only if $A_{i,i} > 0$. Because $A_{5,5} > 0$, there is a loop at $v_5$. Therefore, $G$ is not simple. A graph has multiple edges if and only if there exist two distinct vertices with more than one edge between them. But this occurs if and only if $A_{i,j} > 1$ for some $i, j$. Because $A_{1,2}= 2 > 1$, there are two edges from $v_1$ to $v_2$. But then $G$ is not simple. \pspace

\item A graph $G$ is a multigraph if and only if there exist two distinct vertices with more than one edge between them. But this occurs if and only if $A_{i,j} > 1$ for some $i, j$. Because $A_{1,2}= 2 > 1$, there are two edges from $v_1$ to $v_2$. But then $G$ is a multigraph. \pspace

\item The number of connected components is the number of blocks in its adjacency matrix. Observe that we can block $A$ as follows:
	\[
	A= 
	\begin{pmatrix}[ccc|ccc|c|c]
	0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	2 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
	0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
	0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
	0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
	\end{pmatrix}
	\]
Therefore, there are 4 connected components. \pspace

\item The degree of a vertex from its adjacency matrix can be found by summing the entries in its row---being sure to count loops, i.e. entries along the diagonal, twice. But then we have $\deg v_1= 2 + 1= 3$, $\deg v_8= 2 \cdot 1= 2$, and $\deg v_5= 1 + 2 \cdot 1 + 2= 5$. \pspace

\item The degree of $G$ is the sum of the degrees of its vertices. Using the procedure outlined in (d), we have\dots
	\[
	\deg G= \sum_{v_i} \deg v_i= 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 2= 18
	\]
Alternatively, because $G$ is undirected, we can use the Handshake Theorem. The degree of $G$ is twice the number of edges. The number of edges is the sum of all the entries on or above the diagonal. But then we have $\deg G= 2 |E(G)|= 2 (1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1)= 2 \cdot 9= 18$. 
\end{enumerate}
