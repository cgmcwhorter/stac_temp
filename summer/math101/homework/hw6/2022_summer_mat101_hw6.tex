\homework{6: Due 06/02}{The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the surface of a gas covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 90~million miles away and think this to be normal is obviously some indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be.}{Douglas Adams}

% Problem 9
\problem{10} Suppose you sell automobiles. You earn a weekly baseline salary of \$820 per week and make 3\% commission on your sales. Let $I(s)$ denote your weekly income if you make $s$~dollars in sales. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Explain why $I(s)$ is linear. 
	\item Find $I(s)$.
	\item Find and interpret the slope and $y$-intercept of $I(s)$ in context, if possible. 
	\item How much in sales do you have to make in a given week to have made \$1,500?
	\end{enumerate}

% Problem 10
\problem{10} The amount of people, on average, that have entered a store $t$~hours after it has opened, $P(t)$, can be modeled by $P(t)= 30.5t - 4$. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item What does $P(t)$ being linear imply about the rate that people enter the store?
	\item Find and interpret the slope and $y$-intercept of $I(s)$ in context, if possible.
	\item Find $P(2)$ and interpret the value. 
	\item How long after opening until 400~people have entered the store? 
	\end{enumerate}
