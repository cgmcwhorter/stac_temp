\homework{8: Due 06/08}{I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.}{Issac Newton}

% Problem 1
\problem{10} Use the discriminant to explain why the quadratic function $f(x)= x^2 - 4x + 13$ does not factor `nicely.' Does the function factor `nicely' over the complex numbers? Explain. 



\newpage



% Problem 2
\problem{10} Find the factorization of $x^2 + 9x - 36$ the `traditional' way. Then use the quadratic formula to factor $x^2 + 9x - 36$. Confirm that your factorization is correct. 



\newpage



% Problem 3
\problem{10} Use the quadratic formula to factor $2x^2 - 4x - 12$.
