% Problem 5
\problem{10} Let $G$ be an undirected graph. The \textit{degree sequence} of $G$ is a monotonic non-increasing sequence of the degrees for vertices of $G$. For instance, consider the graph from Problem~i: 
	\[
	\graphOne
	\]
This graph has degree sequence $(5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 0)$. For each of the monotonic non-increasing sequences below, determine whether they are the degree sequence for some simple graph $G$. If there is such a simple graph $G$, give an example. If no such simple graph is possible, explain why.

	\item $(4, 3, 2, 2, 2)$
	\item $(2, 2, 2, 0)$
	\item $(5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)$
