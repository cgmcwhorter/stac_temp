% Problem 1
\problem{10} Prove that the product of two even integers is even and that the product of an even integer with an odd integer is even. \pspace





\newpage





% Problem 2
\problem{10} Prove that if the square of an integer is even, then the integer is even. Use this to prove that if $n^2 + 1$ is a prime greater than 5, then the digit in the 1's place of $n$ is 0, 4, or 6. \pspace





\newpage





% Problem 3
\problem{10} Use the division algorithm to write $180= 7q + r$, where $q, r \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $0 \leq r < 7$. \pspace





\newpage





% Problem 4
\problem{10} Use the division algorithm to prove that the 1's digit of a perfect square is never 2, 3, 7, or 8. \pspace

% Problem 5
\problem{10} Prove or disprove: Let $x, a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$. If $x$ does not divide $a$ and $x$ does not divide $b$, then $x$ does not divide $ab$. \pspace





\newpage





% Problem 6
\problem{10} Prove that if $n$ is composite, then $n$ has a prime factor $p$ with $p \leq \sqrt{n}$. Use this to show that $1321$ is prime. \pspace
