% Course Materials
\mysection{0.22}{Course Materials}{course_mat}
{\itshape\bfseries\color{stacred}Textbook.} The primary reference for course topics will be lecture notes and related materials provided by the instructor. However, students wishing to have a consistent standard reference are suggested to use the free open source textbook \textit{Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction} by Oscar Levin found at \url{http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html} or the online textbook \textit{MCC: MTH 220---Discrete Math} by Judy Dean found at \url{https://math.libretexts.org/Courses/Monroe_Community_College/MTH_220_Discrete_Math}. \pspace

{\itshape\bfseries\color{stacred}Technology.} The course may make use of the computational engine Mathematica via the WolframAlpha website: \url{https://www.wolframalpha.com}. Although WolframAlpha does have a paid account option for additional resources, the course will not make use of these features and students {\itshape will not} be required to setup an account or make any kind of payment. The course may also make use of various programming languages, e.g. Python. These languages will be free and the instructor will provide instructions and resources to be able to make use of them. \sectionbreak

% Grading Components
\mysection{0.27}{Grading Components}{grade_comp}
Course grades are determined by the following components: \par
	\begin{table}[!ht]
        \begin{tabular}{clr}
        & Discussions & 10\% \\
	& Quizzes & 15\% \\
	& Exams & 30\% \\
	& Homeworks & 45\% \\
        \end{tabular} 
        \end{table}
\pspace



% Grading Scale
\mysection{0.18}{Grading Scale}{grade_scale}
The grade scale is the standard St. Thomas Aquinas College grading scale and is as follows: \par
        \begin{table}[!ht]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|l||c|l||c|} \hline
        A & 95 -- 100 & C+ & 77 -- 79 \\ \hline
        A-- & 90 -- 94 & C & 73 -- 76 \\ \hline
        B+ & 87 -- 89 & C-- & 70 -- 72 \\ \hline
        B & 83 -- 86 & D & 65 -- 69 \\ \hline
        B-- & 80 -- 82 & F & 0 -- 64 \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table} \pspace



% Course Format
\mysection{0.19}{Course Format}{course_form}
The course consists of two lectures per week. Each class will begin with a quiz followed by lecture. These lectures will typically consist of a brief overview of a topic followed by time for individual or group problem solving from a daily class activity handout. However, due to the large number of course topics, not every concept or problem type can be covered during class. Students are expected to spend outside of class studying extra materials and solving additional problems. Therefore, students are highly encouraged to solve all the problems from each daily class activity---whether or not they are completed in class. Students are expected to typically spend approximately 3~hours per credit outside of class on course materials. However, some weeks this may be more or less. \sectionbreak



% Attendance and Participation
\mysection{0.36}{Attendance \& Participation}{attend}
{\itshape\bfseries\color{stacred}Attendance.} It is essential to your success in this course that you attend each lecture and participate in class discussions. It is also a federal requirement that students who do not attend or stop attending a class be reported at the time of determination by the faculty that the student never attended or stopped attending the class. Therefore, you are expected to attend each lecture and to show up on time. Address any absence(s), anticipated or unanticipated, with the instructor as soon as possible. Should you anticipate an absence, you are to contact the instructor as soon as possible---at least twenty-four hours before the class, if possible.  Certain absences from lecture(s) may be excused, depending on the reason for the absence. Determinations are made on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the instructor. The student should discuss the issue with the instructor as soon as possible; however, to excuse an absence, the reason(s) for missing lecture(s) must be documentable and presented, if requested. \pspace

If you miss a lecture, you are responsible for any material covered, any work assigned, any course changes made, etc. during the class. Do not assume or expect the instructor to provide you with anything, particularly lecture notes, from the class(es) missed. {\itshape Four or more unexcused absences from lectures could result in receiving a grade penalty per additional absence or an `F' in the course.} Furthermore, excessive lateness will also count as an absence. If you are dismissed from lecture due to problems during the lecture, e.g. disruptive behavior or unauthorized cell phone use, then this dismissal will be recorded as an absence for the lecture. If you cannot attend a class due to illness, inform your instructor immediately so that arrangements can be made. \pspace

{\itshape\bfseries\color{stacred}Participation.} Students are expected to participate in the course---both inside and outside the classroom. Inside the classroom, this means attending class, paying attention, taking notes, asking and answering questions when appropriate, etc. However, course participation does not begin and end at the classroom door. Students are expected to review course material and complete course assignments. Typically, students can expect to spend approximately 3~hours per credit outside of class working for the course---although some weeks this could be more or less. \pspace

Students are highly encouraged to form study groups to help support themselves and their fellow students' learning. These groups can be used to review notes or additional resources, work on class activities, discuss homework problems, etc. However, these groups {\itshape should not} be used to simply solve problems for others or have others solve your problems for you. For instance, students may not `assign' homework problems to each other to solve in order to complete assignments. Using study groups in this or similar manners is an academic integrity violation that will be dealt with harshly. If you are unsure if what plan on doing or are doing in study groups is appropriate, discuss this with your instructor. At no time may students discuss a take-home exam---directly or indirectly---until the instructor has indicated that the exam period has passed. \pvspace{0.3cm}



% Quizzes
\mysection{0.18}{Quizzes}{quiz}
There will be a quiz \textit{every} class. Quizzes are meant to be short and simple. These quizzes serve more as a method of gauging whether you are keeping up with the material. It is important that if you are late that you obtain a copy of the quiz immediately. Quiz solutions will often be discussed following the quiz. Because quiz solutions will often be discussed in class, no make-up quizzes will be given except under extraordinary circumstances determined on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the instructor. Unless otherwise instructed, there are no calculators, computational devices, notes, or outside assistance of any kind allowed on quizzes. \pspace



% Discussions
\mysection{0.18}{Discussions}{discussions}
As part of the course grade, students will be required to meet with their instructor outside of class for a brief discussion---approximately ten minutes---for a minimum of seven such meetings. These meetings may be scheduled with the instructor or occur during office hours. During this meeting, the instructor and student will discuss a topic from the previous week of course material. The discussion will consist of one or more of the following: giving an overview of the topic, stating definitions or theorems, providing examples or counterexamples to particular concepts, briefly solving a simple problem relating to the topic, addressing a common misconception, etc. Students will then be assigned a grade corresponding to their level of mastery related to the topic as demonstrated by this discussion. The topic of the discussion is chosen by the instructor. \pspace

A student's `Discussion' grade will be graded based on seven of these discussions. Students may opt to participate in more than seven of these discussion sessions, in which case the highest seven discussion grades will be taken. While these discussions may occur at any point in a particular week---on a day and at a time agreed upon by the student and instructor---the topic will always be on a topic from the previous week. Students may not be graded on a discussion from topics from topics preceding the previous week unless it relates to the material from the previous week, e.g. notation or definitions learned earlier in the semester appearing in concepts from the previous week. There are no make-ups for these discussions. \pspace

The purpose of these discussions is to hold students accountable for keeping up with course materials and display some level of mastery of course topics without the `harshness' of boolean correct or incorrect responses. Students should not feel nervous about these meetings. These meetings are a {\itshape discussion}. For instance, students may ask for hints or to be reminded of something during the discussion while the instructor may point out errors to allow the student to correct themselves. While still receiving some penalty for incorrect statements, a student can typically demonstrate more of what they know than in a single homework solution. \sectionbreak



% Homeworks
\mysection{0.18}{Homeworks}{hw}
The only way to learn Mathematics is to do Mathematics! Therefore, there will be weekly homework assignments. In fact, students should anticipate being assigned homework {\itshape every} class---typically due the next class. It is essential for students to complete all of the assignments for the course. Working on homework is the best way of engaging with course concepts and gauging one's mastery of the material. Moreover, homework is an essential portion of the course grade. Assignments should be started as soon as possible. Do not delay working through homework; it is easier to keep up than it is to catch up. Students may request extensions on homework assignments. Requests for extensions should be submitted to the instructor in a timely fashion---do not delay! However, do not simply assume that you will be able to receive extra time on an assignment and plan your schedule carefully. Any extensions, due dates, and grade penalties for late assignments will be determined by the instructor on a student-by-student basis. \pspace

You are encouraged to work with others on homeworks. Mathematics is a social activity! The purpose of working together on assignments is to engage with course topics, see different perspectives, ask questions, and have others look over your work. However, do not simply use others to do your assignments. You should also not allow other students to use you to complete their assignments. Of course, using online solutions is a violation of the St. Thomas Aquinas College academic integrity policies. If you are unsure of whether a particular resource is appropriate to use on an assignment, consult with your instructor first. \sectionbreak



% Exams
\mysection{0.18}{Exams}{exams}
During the semester, there will be a total of 3 exams, which are each worth 10\% of the course grade, for a total of 30\%. Each of the three exams will be take-home exams, perhaps except for the last exam which will likely be an in-person exam scheduled for some day the last week of classes. The exact guidelines may differ between the three exams. However, the content covered by an exam, the exam procedures, and the exam due date will be announced the week of the exam. Typically, the exam will be released `that course week', e.g. Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. Students will be expected to solve the problems using the allotted exam time and submit their written exam solutions on Monday morning to their instructor. The anticipated closest-classes to an exam date can be found on the course schedule and are subject to change. \pspace

While exams may be take-home, students are to strictly follow the procedures stated for each exam. Students are expected to take every exam without the use of any course materials or outside materials, unless otherwise instructed. Students may not use more than the allotted time on any exam. If you anticipate conflicts to taking the exam in the allotted time or turning in the exam by the required time, you should contact your instructor immediately. Certainly, if you are aware or should be aware of any issues to taking or submitting an exam before the exam is distributed, you should contact your instructor as soon as possible---certainly as least 24-hours in advance, if possible. Extensions on exams will not be granted except in extraordinary circumstances, determined by the instructor and issued on a case-by-case basis. \sectionbreak



% Mathematics Help
\mysection{0.24}{Mathematics Help}{help}
Be proactive about your success in the course! If you need help, there are many resources available to help you. Your first primary contact for help is the instructor. If you are struggling, attend office hours or send an email. The instructors office hours for this semester can be found below: \par
	\begin{table}[!ht]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l || l}
	Mon. & 11:30~am -- 12:30~pm \\
	Tues. & 11:30~am -- 12:30~pm \\
	Wed. & 11:30~am -- 12:30~pm \\
	Thurs. & 11:30~am -- 12:30~pm \\
	Fri. & 11:30~am -- 1:30~pm
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
Do not wait to bring issues, course related or otherwise, to the attention of the instructor. If you cannot attend office hours, send an email to the instructor to try to make other arrangements. There are also a number of resources available to you at St. Thomas Aquinas College: Center for Student Success, Academic Recovery Program, Writing Center, etc. Students looking for extra mathematics help should consult with the Academic Services Office in Spellman~106, via email at \href{mailto:AcademicServices@stac.edu}{academicservices@stac.edu}, or on the web at \href{https://www.stac.edu/academics/academic-services}{https://www.stac.edu/academics/academic-services}. The Center for Student Success website is \url{https://stac.edu/academics/academic-services/center-for-student-success/} and can be found at Spellman~111 or contacted at 845.398.4090. \sectionbreak



% Respect Policy
\mysection{0.19}{Respect Policy}{respect}
Learning requires a healthy academic environment. A key component to this is respecting everyone's time---especially giving everyone time to fail, ask questions, and learn. Therefore, everyone should abide by the following respect policies: \pspace

The instructor will respect student's time:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item They will come prepared to help you understand the course material and prepare students for quizzes/exams. 
	\item They will listen to student feedback on how to best help them succeed. 
	\item They will return assignments, respond to emails, and give feedback in a timely fashion. 
	\item They will be patient during the student learning process and will treat all students fairly. 
	\end{itemize} \pspace

Students will respect the instructor's time:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item They will be on time to class. Moreover, they will come prepared and pay attention during class. 
	\item They will ask for help and communicate with the instructor in a timely fashion. 
	\item They will keep track of assignments---completing them on time and to the best of their ability.  
	\item They will read and follow course policies. 
	\end{itemize} \pspace

Students will respect each other's time:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item They will not be disruptive in class. If you need to call or text someone, take it outside of the classroom. 
	\item They will work with each other to find solutions and understand course material. However, they will not simply solve problems. 
	\item They will allow each other to make mistakes, ask questions, and participate in the learning process. 
	\item They will use respectful language when speaking to or about one another. 
	\end{itemize}
\sectionbreak



% Email Policy
\mysection{0.18}{Email Policy}{email_policy}
All email communication in this course should be done using your @stac.edu email account. Similarly, any digital course access and file submissions should be made using your @stac.edu email account. Abiding by federal guidelines, emails coming from a non-STAC email may not receive a response. Emails should be properly written: contain appropriate subject line, possess an opening and closing address, be understandable and contain appropriate language, be grammatically correct, have appropriate font style and size, etc. Emails which do not follow these guidelines may not receive a response.
\sectionbreak



% Electronic Device Policy
\mysection{0.31}{Electronic Device Policy}{electronic}
Students are expected to complete the course without the use of calculators or other computational devices on assignments, quizzes, exams, etc., unless otherwise instructed. Any unauthorized use of such devices are considered a violation of the academic integrity policies. During the course, \href{http://www.wolframalpha.com/}{http://www.wolframalpha.com/}, \href{https://www.symbolab.com/}{https://www.symbolab.com/}, and Mathematica may be used to demonstrate concepts give students an opportunity to be able to check work. However, these should only be used as instructed, and never during a quiz or exam. All electronic devices should be turned off and put away during class unless otherwise instructed or given specific permission. Use of such devices can result in dismissal from class.
\sectionbreak



% Mental Health & Counseling Services
\mysection{0.49}{Mental Health \& Counseling Services}{mental_health}
If at any point during the semester, you feel overwhelmed with your class work, feel thoughts of depression/suicide, experience sexual assault/rape, experience problems with substance abuse or relationship abuse, or have any other struggles with physical/mental health, \underline{\bfseries\itshape please seek help}! The Counseling \& Psychological Services (CAPS) at St. Thomas Aquinas College is a resource offering assistance with any issue you might have. There is \underline{\bfseries\itshape never} any shame in seeking help. If you or someone you know is struggling with any of these issues, {\itshape speak out}! The CAPS website can be found at \href{https://stac.edu/student-life/counseling-psychological-services/}{https://stac.edu/student-life/counseling-psychological-services/}. CAPS is located in the upper level of the Romano Student Alumni Center and can be contacted at 845.398.4065. If you or someone you know is having issues with gender or sexual identity issues, CAPS is also there to create a safe space for those with marginalized genders and sexualities or those who might be struggling with these issues.

Students may also make use of the College Health \& Wellness Services located in the McNelis Commons Residence Life Complex, Apartment~2B which can also be contacted at \href{mailto:stachealth@stac.edu}{stachealth@stac.edu} or 845.398.4242, as well as the Campus Ministry and Volunteer Services, directed by Nick Migliorino, located in the Romano Student Alumni Center and can be contacted at \href{mailto:nmiglior@stac.edu}{nmiglior@stac.edu} or 845.398.4084.
\sectionbreak



% Faith/Tradition Observances Policy
\mysection{0.44}{Faith/Tradition Observances Policy}{faith}
The instructor recognizes the diversity of faiths and traditions represented in the campus community. Students should have the right to observe religious holy days according to their faith and traditions. Accordingly, students may notify their instructor, no later than the end of the second week of classes, of any classes that they will be missing due to religious or traditional observances. Students following this guideline will be excused from these classes. Under this policy, students should have an opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work missed due to these observances or have an equitable and appropriate substitution made. All policy and procedural decisions are made at the discretion of the instructor on a student-by-student basis. 
\sectionbreak



% Use of Student Work
\mysection{0.27}{Use of Student Work}{std_work}
In compliance with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), registration in this class is understood as permission for assignments prepared for this class to be used anonymously in the future for educational purposes.
\sectionbreak



% Course Materials Policy
\mysection{0.30}{Course Materials Policy}{copyright}
All course materials (defined to include, but not limited to, course handouts, video/audio lectures, assignments, quizzes, exams, etc.) are the intellectual property of the instructor or St. Thomas Aquinas College, unless the copyright is already explicitly held by some other individual, group, or other entity. Therefore, course materials are protected by United States copyright law, see Title~17~USC. Students in this course are permitted to download some course materials for personal use. \pspace

However, students are not permitted to (in print, digitally, or otherwise) share, distribute, sell, or publish course materials, either in part or in whole, without the instructors explicit written and signed permission along with a personal usage code. Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of course materials is a violation of intellectual property law, and is a violation of the student code of conduct. The instructor, or agent acting on behalf of the instructor with written and signed permission, also reserves the right to delete or disable any link to any course materials. In enrolling in the course, the student agrees to abide by this course materials policy in perpetuity.
\sectionbreak

\mysection{0.20}{Syllabus Policy}{syllabus}
The instructor reserves the right to revise, including substantially revise, the course syllabus at any time---with or without notification. By enrolling in this course, students agree to all the policies found in the syllabus. Wherever applicable, students also agree to follow syllabus policies in perpetuity, e.g. students may not provide unauthorized assistance, materials, etc. to students enrolled in future versions of this course. 
\sectionbreak



% Tips for Success
\mysection{0.21}{Tips for Success}{tips}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep=0.3ex
\item Be proactive about your success in the course.
\item Do not procrastinate! Begin your assignments and studying early!
\item Attend every lecture.
\item Address issues immediately. Ask questions during class, recitation, office hours, etc. 
\item Form a study group! Working together will help you and others better understand the course material as you can work through different difficulties and offer each other clarifications on concepts.
\item Do problems! Reading through your notes is not enough. Seek out new problems and work through them carefully. When you are done, check your answer. If you are wrong, examine carefully what misunderstanding occurred and how to avoid it in the future. If you were correct, examine if there was a faster way, check to see if your solution `flowed' and was easy to read, and think over what concepts/computations were used and what `type' of problem was the exercise.

% Academic Integrity
\mysection{0.25}{Academic Integrity}{college_acadint}

Academic integrity is a commitment to honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility within an academic community. An academic community of integrity advances the quest for truth and knowledge by requiring intellectual and personal honesty in learning, teaching, research, and service. Honesty begins with oneself and extends to others. Such a community also fosters a climate of mutual trust, encourages the free exchange of ideas, and enables all to reach their highest potential. \pspace

A college community of integrity upholds personal accountability and shared responsibility, and ensures fairness in all academic interactions of students, faculty, and administrators. While we recognize the participatory and collaborative nature of the learning process, faculty and students alike must show respect for the work of others by adhering to the clear standards, practices, and procedures contained in the policy described below. \pspace

Academic integrity is essential to St. Thomas Aquinas College’s mission to educate in an atmosphere of mutual understanding, concern, cooperation, and respect. All members of the College community are expected to possess and embrace academic integrity. \sectionbreak



% Academic Dishonesty
\mysection{0.28}{Academic Dishonesty}{college_acaddis}

Academic dishonesty is defined as any behavior that violates the principles outlined above. St. Thomas Aquinas College strictly prohibits academic dishonesty. Any violation of academic integrity policies that constitutes academic dishonesty will be subject to harsh penalties, ranging up to and including dismissal from the College. \pspace

For all Academic Integrity violations, faculty must file a Student Conduct Academic Dishonesty Report, which will be shared with the Dean of the appropriate School, the Provost, and the student. The student will also have to file a Student Academic Integrity Violation Report. Please view the full policy and the associated forms at \url{https://stac.edu/academics/registrar/academic-policies/}. \sectionbreak

% Electronic Use Policy
\mysection{0.27}{Electronic Use Policy}{college_elecuse}

Faculty members at St. Thomas Aquinas College have the discretion to regulate the use of electronic devices in their classes, and students should not use such devices without the expressed permission of the professor. This policy covers cell phones, tablets, laptop computers, or any other device the use of which might constitute a distraction to the professor or to the other students in the class, as determined by the professor. Students with documented disabilities should discuss the use of laptops and/or other electronic devices with their professor at the beginning of the semester. \pspace

When a professor designates a time during which electronic devices may be used, they are only to be used at the discretion of the faculty member and in accordance with the mission of the college. Professors may develop specific and reasonable penalties to deal with violations of these general policies. For more extreme cases of classroom disruption, refer to the College's Disruptive Student Policy. \pspace

Please note that a browser lockdown system may be implemented in order to prevent cheating during assessments such as exams and quizzes. Faculty are expected to confirm that these systems will work with students' laptops before requiring their use. \pspace

{\itshape Recording of Lectures:} Class meetings that include course content or identifiable student information are protected by the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), found at \url{https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html}. At times throughout the semester, the faculty member may record their lecture. It is a best practice for faculty to notify participants that their session is going to be recorded. This recording \textit{\textbf{CANNOT}} be shared with anyone who is not enrolled in this specific course section. \pspace

Students cannot personally record class sessions and then share them outside of the course, although they can maintain them for personal use. \pspace



% Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Statement
\mysection{0.83}{Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Statement}{college_acadacc}

St. Thomas Aquinas College values diverse types of learners and is committed to ensuring that each student is afforded equal access to participate in all learning experiences. If you have a learning difference or a disability---including a mental health, medical, or physical impairment---that would hinder your access to learning in this class, please contact Disability Services. They will confidentially explain the accommodation request process and the type of documentation that may be needed to determine your eligibility for reasonable accommodations. To learn more about academic accommodations for students with disabilities, please contact Anne Schlinck, Director of Disability Services, at \href{mailto:aschlinc@stac.edu}{aschlinc@stac.edu} or call/text 845.398.4087.

% Gender- or Sex-Based Misconduct Policy
\mysection{0.50}{Sexual Misconduct Policy}{college_sexmisconduct}

Students should be aware that faculty members are responsible employees and are required to report certain information to STAC’s Title~IX Coordinator. If you inform your instructor about, or that person witnesses, gender- or sex-based misconduct, which includes sexual harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner or domestic violence, stalking, or any gender- or sex-based discrimination, the faculty member will keep the information as private as possible, but must bring it to the attention of STAC's Title~IX Coordinator. \pspace

Students should also be aware that disclosing such experiences in course assignments does NOT put the College on notice and will NOT begin the process of STAC providing assistance or response to those experiences. \pspace

Please remember that instances of gender- and sex-based misconduct that occur in virtual/online environments are covered by STAC’s Title~IX, Student Code of Conduct, and Faculty/Employee Conduct policies. \pspace

The College encourages individuals who experience, witness or become aware of alleged sexual misconduct to report the incident to the Title~IX Coordinator. The College will assist individuals in contacting law enforcement, if desired. The College also provides individuals the opportunity to discuss alleged incidents with a trained professional on campus with the assurance that the discussion will be confidential. \pspace

The following reporting processes are:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bfseries Non-Confidential Reporting Resources}: If you would like to talk to the Title~IX Coordinator directly, you can contact Mr. Norman Huling (\href{mailto:nhuling@stac.edu}{nhuling@stac.edu}, 845.398.4068).

% Illness and Absences
\mysection{0.49}{Illness and Absences}{college_illnessabsences}

For the health and safety of the campus community, students who are ill {\itshape should not attend classes}. If a student cannot attend classes due to illness, they should:

	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
	\item Communicate this change with their instructor(s) via email. Contact instructors as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours.
	\item Keep up with coursework and participate in class activities as much as possible. Students are responsible for completing any work that they might miss due to illness, including assignments, quizzes, tests, and exams.
	\item Reach out to the instructor if illness will require late submission or modifications of assignments; work with the instructor to reschedule exams and other critical academic activities before they are due.
	\end{enumerate} \sectionbreak



% Diversity and Inclusivity Statement
\mysection{0.44}{Diversity and Inclusivity Statement}{college_inclusive}

St. Thomas Aquinas College is committed to creating an inclusive environment. Our community actively seeks the inclusion and full participation of individuals from groups that have historically experienced discrimination and prejudice. We are committed to a climate of mutual respect and inclusion, one in which diversity is a source of pride rather than a source of division. We encourage all persons---students, faculty, and staff alike---to reflect on their own experiences to explore the ways in which others’ experiences can and do differ; the goal is to use this reflection to learn about different values, cultures, and ways of thinking. Ultimately, a just and equitable society will be easier to realize if we do not exclude those who are different from us and instead practice empathy and inclusivity. \pspace

To that end, if you experience or are aware of bias, mistreatment, or discrimination based on a person's (or your own) membership in a historically under-privileged or marginalized group, please report the incident \href{https://stac.edu/student-life/social-justice-equity/report-incident/}{here}, or contact one of the following individuals to share your concerns: \pspace

Faculty reserve the right to provide open and honest readings and discussions in their classes about personal and institutional biases and prejudices and other topics that may cause discomfort to some. \pspace

More detailed information about the College’s expectations and policies related to these matters can be found in the Student Handbook, specifically in the Student Code of Conduct, Section D: Harassment and Abuse, the Anti-Harassment Policy, and Rules and Regulations for Maintenance of Order. \sectionbreak

% Mental Health & Wellness
\mysection{0.44}{Mental Health \& Wellness}{mental_wellness}

As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in daily activities. \pspace

St. Thomas Aquinas College offers services to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the aforementioned conditions, you can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via the Office of Student Development’s Health and Wellness Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) by visiting \url{https://www.stac.edu/student-life/counseling-psychological-services} or calling 845.398.4065. CAPS is located on the 2nd Floor of the Romano Student Alumni Center (RSAC). \pspace

If you or someone you care about requires immediate assistance during the hours when CAPS is closed, you may reach out to Campus Safety at 845.398.4080. You can also reach an on-call mental health professional by dialing 988 on your phone or visiting the 24-hour emergency help service website at \url{https://988lifeline.org/}. \sectionbreak
