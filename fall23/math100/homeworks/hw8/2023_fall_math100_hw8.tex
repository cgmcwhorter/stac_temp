	\item Predict the current cost of a good that cost \$459.99 last year. 
	\item If the inflation rate in (a) was constant every year, what will be the percentage increase in the cost of goods in 100~years compared to this year?
	\item Suppose that the current cost of a cup of coffee is \$3.50. If the inflation rate for the past 50~years was the rate computed in (a), what was the cost of a cup of coffee 50~years ago?
