\homework{12: Due 11/06}{I know of scarcely anything so apt to impress the imagination as the wonderful form of cosmic order expressed by the [Central Limit Theorem]. The law would have been personified by the Greeks and deified, if they had known of it.}{Sir Francis Galton}

% Problem 1
\problem{10} Your engineering firm has been hired to do quality control analysis for a chip manufacturer. The company requests you analyze their rate of defective chips to minimize any potential harms to their brand. After testing 38 chips, you determine that approximately 4.6\% of the chips have some type of minor defect. Suppose that the standard deviation of the production rate of the chips is known to be $\sigma= 0.012$. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Assuming that the average defect rate in the chips is 4.6\%, find the probability that a same of 38~chips contains a defect percentage of less than 4\%.
	 \item Assuming that the average defect rate in the chips is 4.6\%, find the probability that a same of 38~chips contains a defect percentage of more than 4.5\%. 
	 \item Construct a 97\% confidence interval for the true average defect rate in the chips. 
	\end{enumerate}
