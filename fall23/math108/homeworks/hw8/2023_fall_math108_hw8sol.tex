% Problem 1
\problem{10} The probabilities of several events in a finite probability space are given below:
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	P(A)&= 0.45 &\qquad\qquad P(D)&= 0.10 \\
	P(B)&= 0.20 & P(A \text{ and } C)&= 0.01 \\
	P(C)&= 0.85 & P(B \text{ and } C)&= 0.10 
	\end{aligned}
	\] 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Assuming that $A$ and $B$ are independent, find $P(A \text{ or } B)$.
\item Assuming $C$ and $D$ are disjoint, find $P(C \text{ or } D)$.
\item Are $B$ and $C$ disjoint? Explain.
\item Are $A$ and $C$ independent? Explain. 
\item Find $P(B \;|\; C)$.
\end{enumerate} \pspace

\sol 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item We know that $P(A \text{ or } B)= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)$. If $A, B$ are independent, then $P(A \text{ and } B)= P(A) P(B)$. But then $P(A \text{ and } B)= P(A) P(B)= 0.45 \cdot 0.20= 0.09$. But then\dots
	\[
	P(A \text{ or } B)= P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)= 0.45 + 0.20 - 0.09= 0.56
	\] \pspace

\item Because $C$ and $D$ are disjoint, $P(C \text{ and } D)= 0$. But then\dots
	\[
	P(C \text{ or } D)= P(C) + P(D) - P(C \text{ and } D)= 0.85 + 0.10 - 0= 0.95
	\]
Generally, if events $E$ and $F$ are disjoint, $P(E \text{ or } F)= P(E) + P(F)$. \pspace

\item If $B$ and $C$ were disjoint, then $P(B \text{ or } C)= P(B) + P(C)$. But then $P(B \text{ or } C)= 0.20 + 0.85= 1.05 > 1$, which is impossible. Therefore, $B$ and $C$ cannot be disjoint. \pspace

\item If $A$ and $C$ were independent, then $P(A \text{ and } C)= P(A) P(C)$. But then $P(A \text{ and } C)= 0.01 \neq 0.3825= 0.45 \cdot 0.85= P(A) P(C)$. Therefore, $A$ and $C$ are not independent. \pspace

\item We know that\dots
	\[
	P(B \;|\; C)= \dfrac{P(B \text{ and } C)}{P(B)}= \dfrac{0.10}{0.20}= 0.50
	\]

% Problem 2
\problem{10} A statistician is examining tax rebates for small businesses in the area. She finds that of the 227 small businesses in the county, 109 qualified for a state tax rebate, 80 qualified for a federal tax rebate, and 38 qualified for both. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Find the probability that a randomly selected local small business qualified for a state or federal tax rebate. 
	\item Find the probability that a randomly selected local small business qualified for a state and federal tax rebate. 
	\item Find the probability that a randomly selected local small business qualified for neither a state nor a federal tax rebate. 
	\item Find the probability that a randomly selected local small business qualified for only a state tax rebate. 
	\item Find the probability that a randomly selected local small business that qualified for a state tax rebate also qualified for a federal tax rebate. 
	\end{enumerate} \pspace

\sol 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 
	\[
	\hspace{-1.75cm} P(\text{State or Federal})= P(\text{State}) + P(\text{Federal}) - P(\text{State \& Federal})= \dfrac{109}{227} + \dfrac{80}{227} - \dfrac{38}{227}= \dfrac{71 + 38 + 42}{227}= \dfrac{151}{227} \approx 0.6652

% Problem 2
\problem{10} A large accounting class has 156 students. A chart summarizing the pass/fail/withdraw results for students, broken down by class, is given below. \par
	\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{lccc}
	& Pass & Fail & Withdraw \\ \cline{2-4} 
	\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Freshmen} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{41} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{14} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{6} \\ \cline{2-4} 
	\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Sophomore} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{56} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{11} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{3} \\ \cline{2-4} 
	\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Junior} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{18} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{3} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{1} \\ \cline{2-4} 
	\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Senior} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{3} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{0} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{0} \\ \cline{2-4} 
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table} \pspace
Given the data above, answer the following:
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Find the probability that a randomly selected student failed the course.
	\item Find the probability that a randomly selected student was a sophomore or withdrew from the course.
	\item Find the probability that a randomly selected student was a junior and failed the course.
	\item Find the probability that a randomly selected freshman failed the course.
	\item Are freshmen status and failing the course independent events? Explain. 
	\end{enumerate} \pspace

\sol First, we should find the totals for each row/column:
	\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
	& Pass & Fail & Withdraw & {\itshape Total} \\ \cline{2-4} 
	\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Freshmen} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{41} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{14} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{6} & 61 \\ \cline{2-4} 
	\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Sophomore} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{56} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{11} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{3} & 70 \\ \cline{2-4} 
	\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Junior} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{18} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{3} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{1} & 22 \\ \cline{2-4} 
	\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Senior} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{3} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{0} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{0} & 3 \\ \cline{2-4}
	{\itshape Total} & 118 & 28 & 10 & 156
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 
	\[
	P(\text{failed})= \dfrac{28}{156}= \dfrac{7}{39} \approx 0.1795
	\]

\item 
	\[
	P(\text{soph or withd})= \dfrac{70 + 10 - 3}{156}= \dfrac{77}{156} \approx 0.4936
	\]

\item 
	\[
	P(\text{junior and fail})= \dfrac{3}{156}= \dfrac{1}{52} \approx 0.0192
	\]

\item 
	\[
	P(\text{fail} \;|\; \text{fresh})= \dfrac{P(\text{fail and fresh})}{P(\text{fresh})}= \dfrac{14}{61} \approx 0.2295
	\]

\item If they were independent, then $P(\text{fresh and fail})= P(\text{fresh}) P(\text{fail})$. But $P(\text{fresh and fail})= \frac{14}{156}= 0.0897 \neq 0.0702= \frac{61}{156} \cdot \frac{28}{156}= P(\text{fresh}) P(\text{fail})$. Therefore, they are not independent. Alternatively, if they were independent, then $P(\text{fail} \;|\; \text{fresh})= P(\text{fail})$. But by (a) and (d), $P(\text{fail} \;|\; \text{fresh})= 0.2295 \neq 0.1795= P(\text{fail})$.
