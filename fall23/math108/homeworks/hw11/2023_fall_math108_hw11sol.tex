\homework{11: Due 11/02}{The 50-50-90 rule: anytime you have a 50-50 change of getting something right, there's a 90\% probability you'll get it wrong.}{Andy Rooney}

% Problem 1
\problem{10} News reporting suggests that 30\% of local residents support a tax increase to fund local beautification improvements. You go out into the community to survey individuals to confirm this reporting. Walking up to random individuals on the street, you ask whether they support the tax increase. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Discuss whether the number of people supporting the tax increase is given by a binomial distribution. 
	\item Assuming you survey 12 people and that the number of people supporting the tax increase is given by a binomial distribution and that the news reporting is correct, compute\dots
		\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item Exactly 7 people support the tax increase.
		\item At least 3 people support the tax increase. 
		\item More than 7 people support the tax increase. 
		\item Less than 7 people support the tax increase.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}

% Problem 2
\problem{10} Suppose that surveys suggest that 85\% of individuals have taken an Uber at some point. You take a simple random sample of eight individuals. Find the probability that\dots
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item At least one individual had taken an Uber. 
	\item Exactly five individuals had taken an Uber. 
	\item More than four individuals had taken an Uber. 
	\item At most three individuals had taken an Uber. 
	\end{enumerate}
