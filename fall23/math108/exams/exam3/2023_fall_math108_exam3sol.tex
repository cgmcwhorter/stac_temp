% Question 10
\newpage
\question[10] Researchers are trying to determine the relationship between age, $a$, and Christmas spirit, $S$. They asked 180 individuals aged 1 to 92 their level of Christmas spirit (on a scale of 0 -- 100). Given the scatterplot of the data, plotted below, they create a linear model for the data---also plotted below. The least square regression line was found to be $\widehat{S}(a)= 87.98 - 0.62a$ with $r= 0.956971$. \par

	\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Find $b_0$ and $b_1$ for this model. 
\item Was Christmas spirit positively or negatively correlated with age? Explain.
\item If a participant in this study, aged 29, rated their Christmas spirit as 62, find the residual for this individual. 
\item Find and interpret the coefficient of determination. 
\item Based on (d), is this a `good' linear model? Explain. 
\end{enumerate}
