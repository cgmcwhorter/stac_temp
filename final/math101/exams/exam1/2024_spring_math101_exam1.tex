	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}



% Question 8
\newpage
\question[10] Suppose your overall GPA last semester was 3.433 based on a total of 49~credits. If you expect to receive a GPA this semester of 2.765 based on 16~credits, what would your overall GPA be then?



% Question 9
\newpage
\question[10] You are converting the cost of land in a certain region in the US for a European buyer. If the land cost \$85,000 per acre, what is this in Euros per square kilometer? [\$1.08 = \texteuro 1; 1~acre = 43,560~sq. ft; 1~m$^2$ = 10.7638~ft$^2$]



% Question 10
\newpage
\question[10] Surveillance satellites have taken images of a newly constructed building. The arial view of the roof and its dimensions are shown below.
	\[
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\draw[line width=0.03cm] (0,2) -- (0,0) -- (4,0) -- (6,0) -- (4,2);
	\draw[line width=0.03cm] (4,2) arc (0:180:2);
	\draw[line width=0.03cm,dotted] (0,2) -- (4,2);
	\node at (2,2.3) {\small 300~ft};
	\node at (3,-0.3) {\small 450~ft};
	\node at (5.6,1.25) {\small 212~ft};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\]
	
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Assuming the `upper' portion of this region is a semicircle, find the area of the roof of this building.
\item Assuming the outer walls are perfectly perpendicular with the ground from top to bottom and that the building is 77~ft tall, find the volume of the building.
