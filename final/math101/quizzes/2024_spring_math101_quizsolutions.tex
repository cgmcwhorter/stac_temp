% Quiz 1
\quizsol \textit{True/False}: The integer 131313 is prime. \pspace

\sol The statement is \textit{false}. We know that an integer $N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. We know that $1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3= 12$ is divisible by 3. Therefore, 131313 cannot be prime. In fact, $131313= 3 \cdot 43771= 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 13 \cdot 37$. \pvspace{1.3cm}



% Quiz 2
\quizsol \textit{True/False}: Every rational number can be written as $\frac{a}{b}$, where $\gcd(a, b)= 1$. \pspace

\sol The statement is \textit{true}. By definition, a rational number $r$ is a number of the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are integers and $b \neq 0$. Therefore, we can clearly write every rational number in the form $\frac{a}{b}$. Now can we impose the restriction that $\gcd(a, b)= 1$? Yes! By cancelling common factors from $a, b$, we can assure that the fraction is reduced, i.e. $\gcd(a, b)= 1$. In fact, we can always divide the numerator and denominator by $\gcd(a, b)$. After, we have $\gcd(a, b)= 1$. For instance, take $\frac{10}{15}$. We have $\gcd(10, 15)= 5$. But then $\frac{10}{15} \cdot \frac{1/5}{1/5}= \frac{2}{3}$ is reduced. \pvspace{1.3cm}



% Quiz 3
\quizsol \textit{True/False}: $\dfrac{(x^2)^3 x^5}{x^4}= x^6$ \pspace

\sol The statement is \textit{false}. Recall that $x^a \cdot x^b= x^{a + b}$, $(x^a)^b= x^{ab}$, and $\frac{x^a}{x^b}= x^{a - b}$. We then have\dots
	\[
	\dfrac{(x^2)^3 x^5}{x^4}= \dfrac{x^6 \cdot x^5}{x^4}= \dfrac{x^{11}}{x^4}= x^7
	\]
The mistake made was adding the powers in $(x^2)^3$ to obtain $x^5$ rather than multiplying the powers to obtain the correct $x^6$. \pvspace{1.3cm}



% Quiz 4
\quizsol \textit{True/False}: $\sqrt{\sqrt[3]{x^2}}= x^{2/5}$ \pspace

\sol The statement is \textit{false}. Recall that $\sqrt[n]{x^m}= x^{m/n}$ and $(x^a)^b= x^{ab}$. We then have\dots
	\[
	\sqrt{\sqrt[3]{x^2}}= \sqrt{x^{2/3}}= (x^{2/3})^{1/2}= x^{\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}= x^{1/3}= \sqrt[3]{x}
	\]
The mistake made was adding the denominators rather than multiplying the powers correctly, i.e. $\sqrt{\sqrt[3]{x^2}}= \big( (x^2)^{1/3} \big)^{1/2}= (x^2)^{1/5}= x^{2/5}$, which is incorrect. \pvspace{1.3cm}



% Quiz 5
\quizsol \textit{True/False}: $(1 - 3i)(2 + 5i)= 17 - i$ \pspace

\sol The statement is \textit{true}. Recall that $i^2= -1$. Then we have\dots
	\[
	(1 - 3i)(2 + 5i)= 1(2) + 1(5i) - 3i(2) - 3i(5i)= 2 + 5i - 6i - 15i^2= 2 - i - 15(-1)= 2 - i + 15= 17 - i
	\]





\newpage





% Quiz 6
\quizsol \textit{True/False}: If one increases 76 by 5\% five times sequentially, the result is $76(1 + 0.25)= 76(1.25)= 95$. \pspace

\sol The statement is \textit{false}. If we want to compute $N$ increased or decreased by a \% a total of $n$ times, we compute $N \cdot (1 \pm \%_d)^n$, where $\%_d$ is the percentage written as a decimal, $n$ is the number of times we apply the percentage increase/decrease, and we choose `$+$' if it is a percentage increase and choose `$-$' if it is a percentage decrease. Then to compute $76$ decreased by 5\% consecutively five times, we need take $N= 76$, $\%_d= 0.05$, and choose `$+$'. Therefore, we have\dots
	\[
	N \cdot (1 \pm \%_d)^n= 76 (1 + 0.05)^5= 76(1.05)^5= 76(1.27628)= 96.9974
	\]
From the $76(1.27628)$ portion from the computation above, we can see that increasing a number by 5\% consecutively five times actually results in a 27.628\% increase in the original number's value because $1 + 0.27628= 1.27628$. The mistake made in the quiz is thinking that repeated percentage increases or decreases are additive. An increase of 5\% five times \textit{does not} result in a $5 \cdot 5\%= 25\%$ increase, which was the percentage decrease computed in the quiz statement.
