\homework{14: Due 03/27}{You think you're pretty clever, don't you? I happen to know that every word in your book was published years ago. Perhaps you've read the dictionary!}{Dick Solomon, Third Rock from the Sun}

% Problem 1
\problem{10} Find the inverse of the linear function $\ell(x)= 6x - 1$. Use this inverse function to solve the equation $\ell(x)= 10$. 



\newpage



% Problem 2
\problem{10} Explain why the lines $\ell_1(x)= 5x - 1$ and $\ell_2(x)= 2 - 3x$ intersect. Find their point of intersection. 



\newpage

 

% Problem 3
\problem{10} Find the $x$ and $y$-intercept for the line $y= \dfrac{6x - 11}{3}$.



\newpage



% Problem 4
\problem{10} Let $\ell(x)$ be the linear function given by $\ell(x)= 5x + c$, where $c$ is some constant. Find the value of $c$ such that $\ell(x)$ contains the point $(5, -4)$. What is the $x$-intercept of this line?
