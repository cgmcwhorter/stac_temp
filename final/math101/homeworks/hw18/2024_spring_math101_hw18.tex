\homework{18: Due 04/17}{If you don't learn from your mistakes, there's no sense making them.}{Herbert V. Prochnow}

% Problem 1
\problem{10} Without explicitly solving the quadratic equation, determine whether how many distinct solutions the equation has and whether the solutions are rational, real, or complex. Be sure to justify your answer.
	\[
	x^2= 36 - 5x
	\]



\newpage



% Problem 2
\problem{10} Without explicitly factoring the function $f(x)= x^2 - 8x + 5$ factors `nicely' over the integers, reals, or complex numbers. Be sure to justify your answer. 



\newpage



% Problem 3
\problem{10} Find the roots for the function $f(x)= 2x^2 - 7x + 1$. Solve the following quadratic equation. Be sure to fully justify your answer and show all your work.



\newpage



% Problem 4
\problem{10} Solve the following equation. Be sure to fully justify your answer and show all your work.
	\[
	x(x + 1)= -3
	\]
