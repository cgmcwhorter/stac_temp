% Problem 3
\problem{10} Your biology class course grade is determined by the following components: \par
	\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{lr}
	Homeworks & 60\% \\
	Quizzes & 5\% \\
	Midterm & 15\% \\
	Final & 20\% \\
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table} \par
Suppose that your homework average was 91\%, your quiz average was 81\%, your midterm average was 79\%, and your final exam average was 86\%.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Compute your course average.
	\item If the final exam had not yet occurred, i.e. you had not yet received the 86\%, but all the other course grades were as listed above, then what is your current course average?
	\end{enumerate}
