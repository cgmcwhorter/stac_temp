% Problem 1
\problem{10} Suppose that the number of people served at the DMV is uniformly distributed over the 8 hours that they are open (9~am to 5~pm). 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item What percentage of people are served before noon?
	\item What percentage of people are served after noon?
	\item What percentage of people are served between 11~am and 3~pm? 
	\item At what time has the DMV served 90\% of the people they will assist that day?
	\end{enumerate}

% Problem 2
\problem{10} Suppose you have a normal distribution with mean $\mu= 870$ and standard deviation $\sigma= 113$. Showing all your work, compute the following:
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item $P(X= 900)$
	\item $P(X < 950)$
	\item $P(X > 950)$
	\item $P(800 < X < 950)$
	\end{enumerate}
