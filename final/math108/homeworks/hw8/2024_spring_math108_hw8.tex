\homework{8: Due 02/26}{If you really want something in this life, you have to work for it---now quiet, they're about to announce the lottery numbers!}{Homer Simpson}

% Problem 1
\problem{10} Define what it means for two events $A, B$ to be disjoint---give both the mathematical and `colloquial' definition. Give an example of disjoint events and give an example of non-disjoint events. 



\newpage



% Problem 2
\problem{10} Define what it means for two events $A, B$ to be independent---give both the mathematical and `colloquial' definition. Give an example of independent events and give an example of non-independent events. 



\newpage



% Problem 3
\problem{10} If $A, B$ are events, explain what $P(A \;|\; B)$ means. Give an example with explicit events $A, B$. Explain why $P(A \text{ and } B) \leq P(A)$. 



\newpage



% Problem 4
\problem{10} The probabilities of several events in a finite probability space are given below:
	\[
	\begin{aligned}
	P(A)&= 0.83 &\qquad\qquad P(D)&= 0.15 \\
	P(B)&= 0.49 & P(A \text{ and } B)&= 0.24 \\
	P(C)&= 0.32 & P(B \text{ and } D)&= 0.17 
	\end{aligned}
	\] 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Assuming that $A$ and $C$ are independent, find $P(A \text{ or } C)$.
\item Assuming $B$ and $C$ are disjoint, find $P(B \text{ or } C)$.
\item Are $A$ and $B$ disjoint? Explain.
\item Are $B$ and $D$ independent? Explain. 
\item Find $P(A \;|\; B)$.
\end{enumerate}
