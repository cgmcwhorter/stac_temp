\homework{17: Due 04/15}{Why would you sow secretly? Why would you prune privately? Why would you cull clandestinely? Hidden hoe-ing and whatnot?}{Barbara Howard, Abbott Elementary}

% Problem 1
\problem{10} Find the augmented matrix to the corresponding system of equations:
	\[
	\begin{gathered}
	x + y + z - w= 15 \\
	2x - 3y + 14w= -12 \\
	-x + 5y + 8z= 27 \\
	x - y + z - w= 8
	\end{gathered}
	\]



\newpage



% Problem 2
\problem{10} The matrix below is the initial augmented matrix for a system of linear equations. Find the system of linear equations. 
	\[
	\begin{pmatrix}
	-4 & 1 & 12 \\
	3 & 7 & -11
	\end{pmatrix}
	\]



\newpage



% Problem 3
\problem{10} The following matrix is the RREF of an augmented matrix coming from a system of equations. Did this system of equations have a solution? If the system of equations had a solution, find all the possible solutions. If the system did not have a solution, explain why. 
	\[
	\begin{pmatrix}
	1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 & -5 \\
	0 & 0 & 1 & 12
	\end{pmatrix}
	\]

	\[
	\begin{pmatrix}
	1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 6 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -7 \\
	0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 2 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
