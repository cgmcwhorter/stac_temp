% Course Materials
\mysection{0.22}{Course Materials}{course_mat}
{\itshape\bfseries\color{stacred}Textbook.} The primary reference for course topics will be lecture notes and related materials provided by the instructor. However, students wishing to have a consistent standard reference are suggested to use the free open source textbook \textit{Applied Finite Mathematics} by Rupinder Sekhon and Roberta Bloom found at \url{https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Applied_Mathematics/Applied_Finite_Mathematics_(Sekhon_and_Bloom)} or \textit{Applied Finite Mathematics} by Rupinder Sekhon found at \url{https://archive.org/details/cnx-org-col10613/mode/2up}. \pspace

{\itshape\bfseries\color{stacred}Calculators.} Basic graphing calculators will be allowed during the course, unless otherwise instructed. However, these will not be required. The course may make use of the computational engine Mathematica via the WolframAlpha website: \url{https://www.wolframalpha.com}. Although WolframAlpha does have a paid account option for additional resources, the course will not make use of these features and students {\itshape will not} be required to setup an account or make any kind of payment. \pspace

{\itshape\bfseries\color{stacred}Spreadsheet Software.} 
The course may also make use spreadsheet software such as Excel and GoogleSheets. However, Excel homeworks should be submitted as a \texttt{.xlsx} file. Students should have free access to these resources via their STAC accounts as well as on any campus computer. When using GoogleSheets, students should use their STAC provided Google account. Other online resources may be used in the course and will be provided by the instructor.

\largeheader{0.3cm}{Course Policies}{course_polc}



% Grading Components
\mysection{0.27}{Grading Components}{grade_comp}
Course grades are determined by the following components: \par
	\begin{table}[!ht]
        \begin{tabular}{clr}
	& Quizzes & 15\% \\
	& Homework & 25\% \\
	& Exams & 60\%
        \end{tabular} 
        \end{table}
\sectionbreak



% Grading Scale
\mysection{0.18}{Grading Scale}{grade_scale}
The grade scale is the standard St. Thomas Aquinas College grading scale and is as follows: \par
        \begin{table}[!ht]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|l||c|l||c|} \hline
        A & 95 -- 100 & C+ & 77 -- 79 \\ \hline
        A-- & 90 -- 94 & C & 73 -- 76 \\ \hline
        B+ & 87 -- 89 & C-- & 70 -- 72 \\ \hline
        B & 83 -- 86 & D & 65 -- 69 \\ \hline
        B-- & 80 -- 82 & F & 0 -- 64 \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table} \pspace



% Course Format
\mysection{0.19}{Course Format}{course_form}
The course consists of two lectures per week. Each class will begin with a quiz followed by lecture. These lectures will typically consist of a topic discussion followed by time for individual or group problem solving. However, due to the number and `depth' of course topics, not every concept or problem type can be covered during class. Therefore, you may be assigned reading or videos before lecture. Lectures where readings or video are assigned will still cover course content; however, the focus of these lectures will be problem-solving. Therefore, be sure to do the assigned reading/viewing before the lecture. Regardless, students are expected to spend outside of class reading course material, studying extra materials, and solving additional problems. Students are highly encouraged to do additional practice problems from past semesters available via the course webpage. Finally, students are expected to typically spend approximately 3~hours per credit outside of class on course materials. However, some weeks this may be more or less. \pspace



% Attendance and Participation
\mysection{0.36}{Attendance \& Participation}{attend}
{\itshape\bfseries\color{stacred}Attendance.} It is essential to your success in this course that you attend each lecture and participate in class discussions. It is also a federal requirement that students who do not attend or stop attending a class be reported at the time of determination by the faculty that the student never attended or stopped attending the class. Therefore, you are expected to attend each lecture and to show up on time. Address any absence(s), anticipated or unanticipated, with the instructor as soon as possible. Should you anticipate an absence, you are to contact the instructor as soon as possible---at least twenty-four hours before the class, if possible.  Certain absences from lecture(s) may be excused, depending on the reason for the absence. Determinations are made on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the instructor. The student should discuss the issue with the instructor as soon as possible; however, to excuse an absence, the reason(s) for missing lecture(s) must be documentable and presented, if requested. \pspace

If you miss a lecture, you are responsible for any material covered, any work assigned, any course changes made, etc. during the class. Do not assume or expect the instructor to provide you with anything, particularly lecture notes, from the class(es) missed. {\itshape Four or more unexcused absences from lectures could result in receiving a grade penalty per additional absence or an `F' in the course.} Furthermore, excessive lateness will also count as an absence. If you are dismissed from lecture due to problems during the lecture, e.g. disruptive behavior or unauthorized cell phone use, then this dismissal will be recorded as an absence for the lecture. If you cannot attend a class due to illness, inform your instructor immediately so that arrangements can be made. In this case, the student may be required to participate in lectures virtually and submit assignments online. \pspace

{\itshape\bfseries\color{stacred}Participation.} 
Students are expected to participate in the course---both inside and outside the classroom. Inside the classroom, this means attending class, paying attention, taking notes, asking and answering questions when appropriate, etc. However, course participation does not begin and end at the classroom door. Students are expected to review course material and complete course assignments. Typically, students can expect to spend approximately 3~hours per credit outside of class working for the course---although some weeks this could be more or less. Students are highly encouraged to form study groups to help support themselves and their fellow students' learning. These groups can be used to review notes or additional resources, work on class activities, discuss homework problems, etc. However, these groups {\itshape should not} be used to simply solve problems for others or have others solve your problems for you. For instance, students may not `assign' homework problems to each other to solve in order to complete assignments. Using study groups in this or similar manners is an academic integrity violation that will be dealt with harshly. If you are unsure if what plan on doing or are doing in study groups is appropriate, discuss this with your instructor. \pspace



% Quizzes
\mysection{0.18}{Quizzes}{quiz}
There will be a quiz \textit{every} class. Quizzes are meant to be short and simple. These quizzes serve more as a method of gauging whether you are keeping up with the material. It is important that if you are late that you obtain a copy of the quiz immediately. Quiz solutions will often be discussed following the quiz. Because quiz solutions will often be discussed in class, no make-up quizzes will be given except under extraordinary circumstances determined on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the instructor. Unless otherwise instructed, there are no calculators, computational devices, notes, or outside assistance of any kind allowed on quizzes. \pspace



% Homeworks
\mysection{0.18}{Homeworks}{hw}
The only way to learn Mathematics is to do Mathematics! Therefore, there will be weekly homework assignments. It is essential for students to complete all of the assignments for the course. Working on homework is the best way of engaging with course concepts and gauging one's mastery of the material. Moreover, homework is an essential portion of the course grade. Assignments should be started as soon as possible. Do not delay working through homework; it is easier to keep up than it is to catch up. Students may request extensions on homework assignments. Requests for extensions should be submitted to the instructor in a timely fashion---do not delay! However, do not simply assume that you will be able to receive extra time on an assignment and plan your schedule carefully. Except in exceptional circumstances, homework extensions on topics included in an exam will not be granted beyond that exam date. Any extensions, due dates, and grade penalties for late assignments will be determined by the instructor on a student-by-student basis. \pspace

You are encouraged to work with others on homeworks. Mathematics is a social activity! The purpose of working together on assignments is to engage with course topics, see different perspectives, ask questions, and have others look over your work. However, do not simply use others to do your assignments. You should also not allow other students to use you to complete their assignments. Of course, using online solutions is a violation of the St. Thomas Aquinas College academic integrity policies. If you are unsure of whether a particular resource is appropriate to use on an assignment, consult with your instructor first. \pspace

Homeworks may entail software or programming components. Access to any datasets required for these portions will be provided by the instructor. These portions may require a fair amount of independence on the part of the student. However, there are resources available to help you with these problems. Should you have difficulty with these problems, ask your instructor for help! Be aware that many of your fellow students may be more technologically literate and ask them for help as well! Anticipate that there may be technological issues and always start these problems early! Do not wait until the problem(s) are due to try to complete or submit them. You are responsible for submitting solutions and any files for computer-based problems on-time and in the proper format. Always check the file(s) after submission. Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in grade deductions or rejection of submissions. There is no guarantee that any late solution(s) or file(s) will be accepted. However, if you experience technical difficulties, document the issues thoroughly. 
\sectionbreak



% Exams
\mysection{0.18}{Exams}{exams}
There will be three exams in this course, each worth 20\% of the total course grade for a total of 60\% of the course grade. The schedule of the exams can be found in the `Course Schedule' section of the syllabus. However, these exam dates are subject to change. Students should not make plans to leave campus before May~3rd or otherwise have conflicts on/before that date. Each of the exams covers approximately the third of the course material proceeding the exam date. However, any course topics may appear on any exam. Students should be present, seated, and prepared for a scheduled exam before the exam begins. Students who are late should not expect extra exam time. Furthermore, students who miss an exam should not expect to receive a make-up exam. There will be no make-up exams except under extraordinary circumstances, e.g. in the case of an emergency. However, determinations for make-up exams or other substitutions, with possible grade deductions, are made at the discretion of the instructor on a case-by-case basis. Unless otherwise instructed, no devices or materials other than those provided by the instructor are allowed on any exam. Exams may involve out-of-class portions, which will be submitted at a time and manner specified in lecture. Furthermore, it may be possible that any exam will be a take-home exam. In this case, the exam procedure and schedule will be announced in advance during lecture. \pspace



% Mathematics Help
\mysection{0.24}{Mathematics Help}{help}
Be proactive about your success in the course! If you need help, there are many resources available to help you. Your first primary contact for help is the instructor. If you are struggling, attend office hours or send an email. The instructors office hours for this semester can be found below: \par
	\begin{table}[!ht]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l || l}
	Mon. & 11:30~am -- 12:30~pm \\
	Tues. & 11:30~am -- 12:30~pm \\
	Wed. & 11:30~am -- 12:30~pm \\
	Thurs. & 11:30~am -- 12:30~pm 
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
Do not wait to bring issues, course related or otherwise, to the attention of the instructor. If you cannot attend office hours, send an email to the instructor to try to make other arrangements. There are also a number of resources available to you at St. Thomas Aquinas College: Center for Student Success, Academic Recovery Program, Writing Center, etc. Students looking for extra mathematics help should consult with the Academic Services Office in Spellman~106, via email at \href{mailto:AcademicServices@stac.edu}{academicservices@stac.edu}, or on the web at \href{https://stac.edu/academics/academic-services/}{https://stac.edu/academics/academic-services/}. The Center for Student Success website is \url{https://stac.edu/academics/academic-services/center-for-student-success/} and can be found at Spellman~111 or contacted at 845.398.4090. \pspace



% Respect Policy
\mysection{0.19}{Respect Policy}{respect}
Learning requires a healthy academic environment. A key component to this is respecting everyone's time---especially giving everyone time to fail, ask questions, and learn. Therefore, everyone should abide by the following respect policies: \pspace

The instructor will respect student's time:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item They will come prepared to help you understand the course material and prepare students for quizzes/exams. 
	\item They will listen to student feedback on how to best help them succeed. 
	\item They will return assignments, respond to emails, and give feedback in a timely fashion. 
	\item They will be patient during the student learning process and will treat all students fairly. 
	\end{itemize} \pspace

Students will respect the instructor's time:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item They will be on time to class. Moreover, they will come prepared and pay attention during class. 
	\item They will ask for help and communicate with the instructor in a timely fashion. 
	\item They will keep track of assignments---completing them on time and to the best of their ability.  
	\item They will read and follow course policies. 
	\end{itemize} \pspace

Students will respect each other's time:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item They will not be disruptive in class. If you need to call or text someone, take it outside of the classroom. 
	\item They will work with each other to find solutions and understand course material. However, they will not simply solve problems. 
	\item They will allow each other to make mistakes, ask questions, and participate in the learning process. 
	\item They will use respectful language when speaking to or about one another. 
	\end{itemize}
\sectionbreak



% Email Policy
\mysection{0.18}{Email Policy}{email_policy}
All email communication in this course should be done using your @stac.edu email account. Similarly, any digital course access and file submissions should be made using your @stac.edu email account. Abiding by federal guidelines, emails coming from a non-STAC email may not receive a response. Emails should be properly written: contain appropriate subject line, possess an opening and closing address, be understandable and contain appropriate language, be grammatically correct, have appropriate font style and size, etc. Emails which do not follow these guidelines may not receive a response.
\sectionbreak



% Electronic Device Policy
\mysection{0.31}{Electronic Device Policy}{electronic}
Students are expected to complete the course without the use of calculators or other computational devices on assignments, quizzes, exams, etc., unless otherwise instructed. Any unauthorized use of such devices are considered a violation of the academic integrity policies. During the course, \href{http://www.wolframalpha.com/}{http://www.wolframalpha.com/}, \href{https://www.symbolab.com/}{https://www.symbolab.com/}, and Mathematica may be used to demonstrate concepts give students an opportunity to be able to check work. However, these should only be used as instructed, and never during a quiz or exam. All electronic devices should be turned off and put away during class unless otherwise instructed or given specific permission. Use of such devices can result in dismissal from class.
\sectionbreak

\sectionbreak



% Faith/Tradition Observances Policy
\mysection{0.44}{Faith/Tradition Observances Policy}{faith}
The instructor recognizes the diversity of faiths and traditions represented in the campus community. Students should have the right to observe religious holy days according to their faith and traditions. Accordingly, students may notify their instructor, no later than the end of the second week of classes, of any classes that they will be missing due to religious or traditional observances. Students following this guideline will be excused from these classes. Under this policy, students should have an opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work missed due to these observances or have an equitable and appropriate substitution made. All policy and procedural decisions are made at the discretion of the instructor on a student-by-student basis. 
\sectionbreak

\largeheader{0.5cm}{College Policies}{college_polc}

% Academic Integrity
\mysection{0.25}{Academic Integrity}{college_acadint}

Academic integrity is a commitment to honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility within an academic community. An academic community of integrity advances the quest for truth and knowledge by requiring intellectual and personal honesty in learning, teaching, research, and service. Honesty begins with oneself and extends to others. Such a community also fosters a climate of mutual trust, encourages the free exchange of ideas, and enables all to reach their highest potential. \pspace

A college community of integrity upholds personal accountability and shared responsibility, and ensures fairness in all academic interactions of students, faculty, and administrators. While we recognize the participatory and collaborative nature of the learning process, faculty and students alike must show respect for the work of others by adhering to the clear standards, practices, and procedures contained in the policy described below. \pspace

Academic integrity is essential to St. Thomas Aquinas College's mission to educate in an atmosphere of mutual understanding, concern, cooperation, and respect. All members of the College community are expected to possess and embrace academic integrity. \sectionbreak




% Academic Dishonesty
\mysection{0.28}{Academic Dishonesty}{college_acaddis}

Academic dishonesty is defined as any behavior that violates the principles outlined above. St. Thomas Aquinas College strictly prohibits academic dishonesty. Any violation of academic integrity policies that constitutes academic dishonesty, including the use of AI tools without the explicit permission of the instructor, will be subject to harsh penalties, ranging up to and including suspension from the College. \pspace

For all Academic Integrity violations, faculty must file a Student Conduct Academic Dishonesty Report, which will be shared with the Dean of the appropriate School, the Provost, and the student. The student will also have to file a Student Academic Integrity Violation Report. Please view the full policy and the associated forms at \url{https://stac.edu/academics/registrar/academic-policies/}. \pspace



% Electronic Use Policy
\mysection{0.27}{Electronic Use Policy}{college_elecuse}

Faculty members at St. Thomas Aquinas College have the discretion to regulate the use of electronic devices in their classes, and students should not use such devices without the expressed permission of the professor. This policy covers cell phones, tablets, laptop computers, or any other device the use of which might constitute a distraction to the professor or to the other students in the class, as determined by the professor. Students with documented disabilities should discuss the use of laptops and/or other electronic devices with their professor at the beginning of the semester. \pspace

When a professor designates a time during which electronic devices may be used, they are only to be used at the discretion of the faculty member and in accordance with the mission of the college. Professors may develop specific and reasonable penalties to deal with violations of these general policies. For more extreme cases of classroom disruption, refer to the College's Disruptive Student Policy. \pspace

Students cannot personally record class sessions and then share them outside of the course, although they can maintain them for personal use. \sectionbreak




% Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Statement
\mysection{0.83}{Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Statement}{college_acadacc}

St. Thomas Aquinas College values diverse types of learners and is committed to ensuring that each student is afforded equal access to participate in all learning experiences. If you have a learning difference or a disability---including a mental health, medical, or physical impairment---that would hinder your access to learning in this class, please contact Disability Services. They will confidentially explain the accommodation request process and the type of documentation that may be needed to determine your eligibility for reasonable accommodations.

% Gender- or Sex-Based Misconduct Policy
\mysection{0.50}{Sexual Misconduct Policy}{college_sexmisconduct}

Students should be aware that faculty members are responsible employees and are required to report certain information to STAC's Title~IX Coordinator. If you inform your instructor about, or that person witnesses, gender- or sex-based misconduct, which includes sexual harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner or domestic violence, stalking, or any gender- or sex-based discrimination, the faculty member will keep the information as private as possible, but must bring it to the attention of STAC's Title~IX Coordinator. \pspace

Students should also be aware that disclosing such experiences in course assignments does NOT put the College on notice and will NOT begin the process of STAC providing assistance or response to those experiences. \pspace

Please remember that instances of gender- and sex-based misconduct that occur in virtual/online environments are covered by STAC's Title~IX, Student Code of Conduct, and Faculty/Employee Conduct policies. \pspace

The College encourages individuals who experience, witness or become aware of alleged sexual misconduct to report the incident to the Title~IX Coordinator. The College will assist individuals in contacting law enforcement, if desired. The College also provides individuals the opportunity to discuss alleged incidents with a trained professional on campus with the assurance that the discussion will be confidential. \pspace

The following reporting processes are:






	\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bfseries Non-Confidential Reporting Resources}: If you would like to talk to the Title~IX Coordinator directly, you can contact Mr. Norman Huling (\href{mailto:nhuling@stac.edu}{nhuling@stac.edu}, 845.398.4068).

% Illness and Absences
\mysection{0.49}{Illness and Absences}{college_illnessabsences}

For the health and safety of the campus community, students who are ill {\itshape should not attend classes}. If a student cannot attend classes due to illness, they should:

	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
	\item Communicate this change with their instructor(s) via email. Contact instructors as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours.
	\item Keep up with coursework and participate in class activities as much as possible. Students are responsible for completing any work that they might miss due to illness, including assignments, quizzes, tests, and exams.
	\item Reach out to the instructor if illness will require late submission or modifications of assignments; work with the instructor to reschedule exams and other critical academic activities before they are due.
	\end{enumerate} \sectionbreak



% Diversity and Inclusivity Statement
\mysection{0.44}{Diversity and Inclusivity Statement}{college_inclusive}

St. Thomas Aquinas College is committed to creating an inclusive environment. Our community actively seeks the inclusion and full participation of individuals from groups that have historically experienced discrimination and prejudice. We are committed to a climate of mutual respect and inclusion, one in which diversity is a source of pride rather than a source of division. We encourage all persons---students, faculty, and staff alike---to reflect on their own experiences to explore the ways in which others’ experiences can and do differ; the goal is to use this reflection to learn about different values, cultures, and ways of thinking. Ultimately, a just and equitable society will be easier to realize if we do not exclude those who are different from us and instead practice empathy and inclusivity. \pspace

To that end, if you experience or are aware of bias, mistreatment, or discrimination based on a person's (or your own) membership in a historically under-privileged or marginalized group, please report the incident \href{https://stac.edu/student-life/social-justice-equity/report-incident/}{here}, or contact one of the following individuals to share your concerns: 
	
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{l}
	{\bfseries Samantha Bazile} \\
	Director of Admissions \& \\
	Chief Diversity Officer \\
	845.398.4104 \\
	\href{mailto:sbazile@stac.edu}{sbazile@stac.edu}
	 \end{tabular} 
	 \end{center}

Faculty reserve the right to provide open and honest readings and discussions in their classes about personal and institutional biases and prejudices and other topics that may cause discomfort to some. \pspace

More detailed information about the College’s expectations and policies related to these matters can be found in the Student Handbook, specifically in the Student Code of Conduct, Section D: Harassment and Abuse, the Anti-Harassment Policy, and Rules and Regulations for Maintenance of Order. \sectionbreak



% Mental Health & Wellness
\mysection{0.44}{Mental Health \& Wellness}{mental_wellness}

As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in daily activities. \pspace

St. Thomas Aquinas College offers services to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing. If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the aforementioned conditions, you can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via the Office of Student Development’s Health and Wellness Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) by visiting \url{https://www.stac.edu/student-life/counseling-psychological-services} or calling 845.398.4065. CAPS is located on the 2nd Floor of the Romano Student Alumni Center (RSAC). \pspace

If you or someone you care about requires immediate assistance during the hours when CAPS is closed, you may reach out to Campus Safety at 845.398.4080. You can also reach an on-call mental health professional by dialing 988 on your phone or visiting the 24-hour emergency help service website at \url{https://988lifeline.org/}. \sectionbreak
